<h1>The “Silk Cursor”: Investigating Transparency for 3D Target Acquisition</h1>
</p> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong>
<p> This study investigates dynamic 3D target acquisition. The focus is on the relative effect of specific perceptual
    cues. A novel technique is introduced and we report on an experiment that evaluates its effectiveness. There are two
    aspects to the new technique. First, in contrast to normal practice, the tracking symbol is a volume rather than a
    point. Second, the surface of this volume is semi-transparent, thereby affording occlusion cues during target
    acquisition. The experiment shows that the volumehcclusioneffective in both monocular and stereoscopic conditions.
    For some tasks where stereoscopic presentation is unavailable or infeasible, the new techniaue offers an effective
    alternative.</p>

<p> <strong> Experimental Task </strong>
<p style="background-color: yellow;"> A 3D dynamic target acquisition task, “virtual fishing”, was designed for the
    experiment. In each trial of the experiment, an “angel fish” with random size and color appears swimming around
    randomly within a 3D environment, as shown in Fig. 3</p>

</p>
<p style="background-color: yellow;"> Eleven male and one female paid volunteers served as subjects in this experiment.
    The subjects were screened through the Bausch & Lomb Orthorator visual acuity and stereopsis tests. Subjects ages
    ranged from 18 to 36, with the majority in their early and mid-20’s. One of the 12 subjects was left handed and the
    rest were right handed, as determined by the Edinburgh inventory. Subjects were asked to wear the input glove on
    their dominant hand</p>
<p> A balanced within subjects design was used. The 12 subjects were randomly assigned to a unique order of the four
    conditions (SS, SW, MS, MW) by a hyper-Graeco- Latin square pattern, which resulted in every condition being
    presented an equal number of times as fiist, second, third and finat condition.</p>
<p> Following a 2 minute demonstration of all experimental conditions, the experiments with each subject were divided
    into four sessions, with one experimental condition in each session. There was a 1 minute rest between every two
    sessions. Each session comprised 5 tests. Test 1 started when the subject had no experience with the particulw
    experimental condition. Test 2, 3, 4, and 5 started after the subjects had 3, 6, 9 and 12 minutes experience
    respective y. Practice trials occurred between the tests. Each test had 15 trials of fish catching. At the end of
    each test, the number fish both caught and missed (as both an absolute number and a relative percentage) and mean
    trial time were displayed to the subject.</p>
<p> At the end of the experiment, a short questionnaire was conducted to colleci users’ subjective preferences for all
    experimental conditions.</p>

<p style="background-color: yellow;"> Two points of particular interest
    with
    respect to the silk cursor distinguish this research from other
    studies. One
    of these is the fact that the silk cursor does not block completely
    the view
    of any object which it occludes, due to the fact that it is
    semi-transparent. In essence, therefore, we contend that not only
    are
    important enhancements of depth perception to be gained through
    application
    of occlusion cues, but the one clear disadvantage of complete
    occlusion is
    greatly diminished – namely, the fact that all information about
    objects
    being obscured by an opaque intervening object is necessarily lost,
    For such
    practical computer- related applications as pursuit tracking,
    docking,
    target acquisition, etc., this is expected to present a significant
    advantage.</p>

<p> <strong>CONCLUSION</strong>
<p> We have proposed a semi-transparent silk volume cursor, to serve as
    a novel
    technique for performing target acquisition type tasks in 3D
    environments.
    Within
    the context of a carefully designed “virtual fishing” experiment
    that
    represented a
    dynamic 3D target acquisition task, the silk volume cursor
    demonstrated
    superior
    performance over a comparable wire frame cursor, both in stereo and
    in mono
    display
    modes.</p>
