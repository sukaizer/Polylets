  <p><strong>The "Prince" Technique: Fitts' Law and Selection Using Area Cursors</strong></p>
  <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
  <p>In most GUIs, selection is effected by placing the point of the mouse-driven cursor over the area of the object to
    be selected. Fitts' law is commonly used to model such target acquisition, with the term A representing the
    amplitude, or distance, of the target from the cursor, and W the width of the target area. As the W term gets
    smaller, the index of difficulty of the task increases. The extreme case of this is when the target is a point. In
    this paper, we show that selection in such cases can be facilitated if the cursor is an area, rather than a point.
    Furthermore, we show that when the target is a point and the width of the cursor is W, that Fitts' law still holds.
    An experiment is presented and the implications of the technique are discussed for both 2D and 3D interfaces.</p>

  <p style="background-color: yellow;">Twelve students from the University of Toronto participated as paid volunteers.
    All had experience using the mouse and were strongly right handed based on the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [10].

  <p style="background-color: yellow;">A second capability of the area cursor is that it may function as a "net." Used
    in this way, an area cursor can group and select a collection of points or small objects with a single pointing
    movement, much as the "lasso" tool is used in drawing applications like MacDraw. This capability, however, also
    serves to illustrate a drawback with using the area cursor as the only selection tool in a GUI. This is that the
    Prince technique is inappropriate for fine positioning tasks, because selections may become ambiguous when displays
    are cluttered.</p>
  <p style="background-color: yellow;">Our belief is that an effective way of exploiting the Prince technique is to
    combine it with the traditional point-cursor approach. Where fine positioning is not required, it may be possible to
    replace it by coarse positioning and the Prince technique. Furthermore, by dynamically switching between Prince and
    point-cursor positioning techniques, the difficulty of positioning tasks can be matched more closely to task
    context.</p>

  <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
  <p>An alternative approach to pointing, called the Prince technique, was investigated and found to be comparable to
    traditional pointing methods. Because the Prince technique uses a cursor of large area or volume, it is suitable for
    tasks that are normally difficult with the standard pointer, such as acquiring small targets or points. We feel that
    the Prince technique may be especially valuable when used in conjunction with traditional pointing techniques, where
    it can be used to tailor task difficulty more closely to the accuracy demands of the task. The examples presented
    three distinct methods suggesting how this might be accomplished.</p>
  <p>The current study is an initial probe into a rich design space. Many questions and issues remain. We investigated
    selection tasks involving one width parameter, either the target or the cursor. What happens when there are two
    width parameters, defined by moving and stationary objects? The whole issue of "grasping" isolated objects from
    among a close cluster requires much more investigation. Likewise, the 3D case of the volume cursor deserves study.
    It would also be worthwhile to compare and/or combine the technique with gravitational "snapping" techniques.
    Finally, for the full potential of the technique to be realized, it is likely that new affordances (such as
    supporting "grasping") need to be built into input devices, such as mice. This also requires further study.</p>
