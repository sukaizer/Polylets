  <p><strong>Making Computers Easier for Older Adults to Use: Area Cursors and Sticky Icons</strong></p>
  <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
  <p>The normal effects of aging include some decline in cognitive, perceptual, and motor abilities. This can have a
    negative effect on the performance of a number of tasks, including basic pointing and selection tasks common to
    today’s graphical user interfaces. This paper describes a study of the effectiveness of two interaction techniques:
    area cursors and sticky icons, in improving the performance of older adults in basic selection tasks. The study
    described here indicates that when combined, these techniques can decrease target selection times for older adults
    by as much as 50°/0 when applied to the most difficult cases (smallest selection targets). At the same time these
    techniques are shown not to impede performance in cases known to be problematical for related techniques (e.g.,
    differentiation between closely spaced targets) and to provide similar but smaller benefits for younger users.</p>
  <p><strong>KEYWORDS</strong></p>
  <p>Graphical interfaces, user input, interaction techniques, pointing and selection tasks, Fitts’ law, aging.</p>
  <p style="background-color: yellow;">Researchers have studied a translucent cursor design to remedy the problem of
    large cursors that obscure potentially important screen information. The results of their experiments suggest that
    viewing information behind translucent cursors does not hinder performance [11]. We utilized this translucent design
    in our study and investigated a new feature that should improve performance for discrimination tasks with area
    cursors.</p>
  <p style="background-color: yellow;">The participants were 16 younger and 16 older adults. The younger adults (mean
    age = 23.4 years) were recruited undergraduate and graduate students from the Georgia Institute of Technology. All
    students were regular users of computers with a mouse as the pointing device. The older adults (mean age = 70.1
    years) were recruited from the older adults subject pool of the psychology department at the university. The older
    adults had all participated previously in a study that provided three hours of training using a computer mouse
    followed by a three-hour experiment that required them to use the mouse as a pointing device. The older adults were
    paid US $50 for their participation in the experiment. Younger subjects were either volunteers or received course
    credit for their participation. An incentive of $25 per 8 participants was awarded based on overall performance in
    the experimental task.</p>

  <p style="background-color: yellow;">Ouestion 2: Could the area cursor be used to discriminate between adjacent icons?
  </p>
  <p>To address this issue we looked at the interaction between intervening icon and cursor type. This interaction was
    significant (F (2,56) = 35.51, p < .001). Follow-up tests revealed that the area cursor led to faster movements when
      there was no intervening icon or when the intervening icon was far from the target icon. More importantly, there was
      no dl~erence between area cursors and pointer cursors when the intervening icon was next to the target. This shows
      that both younger and older adults were able to use the area cursor with the adaptive function to select small
      targets in a crowded environment.</p>
      <p>Quest ion 3: Did the use of stickv icons aid Performance?</p>
      <p>The analyses of icon type and adaptive gain function both yielded effects that approached significance (p less
        than .10). There was however, a significant interaction of icon type and target width (F (3,84) = 19.24, p <
          .001). Follow-up tests revealed that there was a beneficial effect of sticky icons when target width was at its
          smallest as compared to the largest target size. As can be seen in Table 1, older adults seem to benefit more
          from sticky icons and the adaptive gain function than younger adults. However, the beneficial effect of the
          adaptive gain function should be interpreted with caution as this was a between subjects variable and this group
          was faster in all conditions.</p>
          <p>Question 4: How much can cursor positioning performance be improved for older adults</p>
          <p>In order to determine the amount of improvement in positioning that can be gained from the various design
            interventions, we compared mean positioning time for older and younger adults on the two extreme types of
            cursor systems: “normal” cursor, where there is a pointer cursor, non-sticky icons and no dynamic gain
            fimction; and “fully augmented” cursor, where there is an area cursor, sticky icons and the dynamic gain
            function. Comparing movement performance for these two extremes we see a clear advantage for the filly
            augmented cursor (means = 591 for younger, 1204 for older) compared to the normal cursor (means = 759 for
            younger, 1894 for older). The advantage for using the fully augmented cursor is even greater if we compare the
            means for the condition with no intervening icons and the targets were smallest. For older adults movement
            time was 2421 msec for the normal cursor and only 1204 msec for the fully augmented cursor, a drop in movement
            time of more than 50%. The same pattern of results was found for younger adults (mean for normal = 941 msec,
            600 for fully augmented) although the effects were not as dramatic.</p>

  <p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>
  <p>This study clearly demonstrates that cursor positioning among older computer users can be improved. As we reported
    previously [8], older computer users position the cursor much more slowly than younger computer users and have great
    difficulty making correct movements to small targets. However, the time required to move the cursor to a small
    target was cut by over 50V0when using a fully augmented pointing system as compared to the system used on most
    computer systems.</p>
  <p>The study also shows that both older and younger computer users can use the area cursor effectively. When an icon
    was not in close proximity to another icon, cursor positioning time was much faster with the area cursor. When there
    were two icons next to one another, both older and younger computer users could select a single icon as quickly and
    easily with the area cursor as the pointer cursor. The results show that use of an adaptive hot-spot with the area
    cursor seems to have eliminated one drawback to it use. The results of the study also show that sticky icons can be
    beneficial, especially for older adults. The effects are not as dramatic as those for the area cursor, but there was
    a clear benefit in positioning time with smaller targets. As this is a particular cursor positioning problem with
    older adults, the use of sticky icons could help alleviate this problem.</p>
  <p>In addition to the obvious benefits for positioning time that result from this system, this approach to solving
    age- related problems in computer usage can be easily implemented on current interfaces. Rather than making changes
    to all software, these options can be made part of mouse driver software and will then apply to all programs used.
