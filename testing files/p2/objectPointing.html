  <p><strong>Object Pointing: A Complement to Bitmap Pointing in GUIs</strong></p>
  <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
  <p>Pointing has been conceptualized and implemented so far as the act of selecting pixels in bitmap displays. We show
    that the current technique, which we call bitmap pointing (BMP), is often sub-optimal as it requires continuous
    information from the mouse while the system often just needs the discrete specification of objects. The paper
    introduces object pointing (OP), a novel interaction technique based on a special screen cursor that skips empty
    spaces, thus drastically reducing the waste of input information. We report data from 1D and 2D Fitts’ law
    experiments showing that OP outperforms BMP and that the performance facilitation increases with the task’s index of
    difficulty. We discuss the implementation of OP in current interfaces. Key words: Input and Interaction
    Technologies, Pointing, Fitts’ law.</p>

  <p><strong>Experimental Task</strong></p>
  <p style="background-color: yellow;">The pointing paradigm was serial, but no longer reciprocal in the sense of a back
    and forth (stationary) movement. To track the green target, which every successful click made to jump to another
    unpredictably determined object, the participant had to produce a series of clicks to follow the path dictated by
    the program across graphical objects. This task was designed to mimic a rather common situation in GUIs (e.g.,
    reaching and clicking the FILE menu, then the OPEN item, then browsing a tree, etc.). This also show that OP can
    apply to many types of widgets such as menus, buttons and icons. Within each display, 11 successive clicks had to be
    made, yielding blocks of 10 measurements of MT. If a target object was missed by the click, it remained the target,
    waiting for a correct click, and so a 0% error rate was imposed on all participants.</p>

  </p>
  <p><strong>Implications for HCI Design</strong></p>
  <p style="background-color: yellow;">Rather than an alternative to BMP, OP should be viewed as an optional mode made
    available to users beside the usual BMP mode. One should be allowed to switch opportunistically from BMP to OP, via
    some simple mouse command, to occasionally cope with pixels (e.g., in a drawing task). So the interface should
    provide the user with some convenient means to switch back and forth between OP and BMP.</p>
  <p style="background-color: yellow;">Obviously, OP does not yield any benefit for selection within display regions
    that are tiled with graphical objects, because such regions offer no voids. For example, following a horizontal path
    to reach the next hierarchical level in a cascading menu costs time [2], but for little or no gain: the probability
    that the cursor aims at the next (previous) level of the hierarchy when it starts moving to the right (left) is
    about 1. One solution is to make the menu highlight jump by discrete steps depending on the initial direction of
    cursor motion [13]. Facilitating pointing across tiled spaces with such a technique might nicely complement OP.</p>
  <p><strong>Future Work</strong></p>
  <p style="background-color: yellow;">One problem that remains to be addressed is the design of an appropriate command
    to switch back and forth between OP and BMP. Among the possibilities, we may think of a combination of mouse-button
    presses or a brief oscillation of the cursor. The latter option seems particularly worth examining. Quick, small
    amplitude oscillations of the hand, very easy to produce [9], might usefully enrich the vocabulary of input
    commands.</p>
