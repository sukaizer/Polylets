In particular, in an early cue conflict study, Schriever [10] compared the relative influences of binocular disparity (i.e. stereoscopic displays), perspective, shading and occlusion, and showed among other things the dominance of occlusion over disparity information. More recently, Bratmstein et at [1] showed that conflicting edge- occlusion dominates disparity. Even more recently, Wickens et al [14] in a review of depth combination literature, concluded that motion, disparity and occlusion are the most powerful depth cues in displays. The results presented here clearly contribute to that literature by illustrating some of the powerful advantages that can be afforded by augmenting visual feedback through either partial occlusion or binocular disparity, and in particular both in combination."}]},{"nodeType":1,"tagName":"p","attributes":[["style","background-color: yellow;"]],"childNodes":[{"nodeType":3,"nodeName":"#text","nodeValue":" Two points of particular interest with respect to the silk cursor distinguish this research from other studies. One of these is the fact that the silk cursor does not block completely the view of any object which it occludes, due to the fact that it is semi-transparent. In essence, therefore, we contend that not only are important enhancements of depth perception to be gained through application of occlusion cues, but the one clear disadvantage of complete occlusion is greatly diminished – namely, the fact that all information about objects being obscured by an opaque intervening object is necessarily lost, For such practical computer- related applications as pursuit tracking, docking, target acquisition, etc., this is expected to present a significant advantage."}]},{"nodeType":1,"tagName":"p","childNodes":[{"nodeType":3,"nodeName":"#text","nodeValue":" The second point relates to the fact that the silk cursor provides discrete, rather than continuous, levels of depth information. This is in contrast to stereoscopic displays, which are able to provide information not only about wherher one object is farther away than another object but also to a significant extent by how much they are separated in space, by means of binocular depth scaling. The silk cursor, on the other hand, is not able to provide this information. In Fig. 5 we see that the error rate for the MS case was lower than that of the SW case, which supports the effectiveness of the silk cursor as a discrete capturing device. However, upon examining Fig. 6 we note that the magnitude of errors for the MS case are larger than those of the SW case. The implication of this is that, although fewer errors were made with the silk surface cursor, the magnitude of those fewer errors must have been relatively larger than for the SW case, suggesting that continuous depth information was not being used."}]},{"nodeType":1,"tagName":"p","childNodes":[{"nodeType":3,"nodeName":"#text","nodeValue":" In summary, we are quite encouraged by these results with the semi-transparent silk cursor, especially for applications in 3D interactive environments.
