This decreased ability can have a major effect on the ability of older adults to use a pointing device on a computer. Some of our previous work [8,9] has shown that even experienced older computer users move a cursor much more slowly and less accurately than their younger counterparts. In addition, older adults seem to have increased difficulty (as compared to younger users) when the targets become smaller. In our most recent work, we found that older computer users took over twice as long and made more than five times as many cursor positioning errors as younger users when moving to small icons [8]. Yet the icons used in that study were larger than some of those found on current interfaces. For older computer users, difficulty in positioning a cursor can be a severe limitation."}]},{"nodeType":3,"nodeName":"#text","nodeValue":" "}]},{"nodeType":1,"tagName":"p","childNodes":[{"nodeType":1,"tagName":"br"}]},{"nodeType":1,"tagName":"p","childNodes":[{"nodeType":3,"nodeName":"#text","nodeValue":" [] "},{"nodeType":1,"tagName":"a","attributes":[["id","elementId3"]],"childNodes":[{"nodeType":3,"nodeName":"#text","nodeValue":"Fitts' Law and Selection Using Area Cursors ABSTRACT In most GUIs, selection is effected by placing the point of the mouse-driven cursor over the area of the object to be selected. Fitts' law is commonly used to model such target acquisition, with the term A representing the amplitude, or distance, of the target from the cursor, and W the width of the target area. As the W term gets smaller, the index of difficulty of the task increases. The extreme case of this is when the target is a point. In this paper, we show that selection in such cases can be facilitated if the cursor is an area, rather than a point. Furthermore, we show that when the target is a point and the width of the cursor is W, that Fitts' law still holds. An experiment is presented and the implications of the technique are discussed for both 2D and 3D interfaces.

Interfaces based on windows, icons, menus, and pointing (so called WIMP interfaces) allow fairly non- trivial operations to be performed with a few mouse clicks. However, for older adults there is evidence that even simple mouse clicks can be quite challenging [8,9]. The trade-off between the accessibility of targets and the amount of information presented is a fundamental issue in human-computer interface design. People have particular difficulty working with small icons often utilized to fit a lot of information into one display.

The focus is on the relative effect of specific perceptual cues. A novel technique is introduced and we report on an experiment that evaluates its effectiveness. There are two aspects to the new technique. First, in contrast to normal practice, the tracking symbol is a volume rather than a point. Second, the surface of this volume is semi-transparent, thereby affording occlusion cues during target acquisition. The experiment shows that the volumehcclusioneffective in both monocular and stereoscopic conditions. For some tasks where stereoscopic presentation is unavailable or infeasible, the new techniaue offers an effective alternative.

This can have a negative effect on the performance of a number of tasks, including basic pointing and selection tasks common to today’s graphical user interfaces. This paper describes a study of the effectiveness of two interaction techniques: area cursors and sticky icons, in improving the performance of older adults in basic selection tasks. The study described here indicates that when combined, these techniques can decrease target selection times for older adults by as much as 50°/0 when applied to the most difficult cases (smallest selection targets). At the same time these techniques are shown not to impede performance in cases known to be problematical for related techniques (e.g., differentiation between closely spaced targets) and to provide similar but smaller benefits for younger users.
