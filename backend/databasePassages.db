{"id":0,"locId":0,"passage":"STATE OF PRIOR ART\nMore particularly, the invention relates to a disc brake including a braking disc overlapped by a fixed caliper carrying a pair of friction pads each facing a disc face, at least two mechanical actuators carried by the caliper and each including a movable piston and a driving member connected to the piston by a helical connection each to move a plate in order to press it against the disc, as well as an electric motor and a mechanism for transmitting to the driving members to move the driving members of both mechanical actuators.\n\nIn a disc brake with a hydraulic type fixed caliper, the hydraulic actuators located on either side of the disc each press a pad against the disc when the hydraulic circuit is pressurised, in order to generate a braking force.\n\nOver time, the pads which are opposite to each other and on either side of the disc are differently worn, such that their thicknesses become different.\n\nIn the case of a hydraulic caliper, the thickness difference of the pads is compensated for by the fact that both actuators are connected to a same hydraulic circuit. With such a circuit, the operation corresponds to that of a force control, which hence enables that the pistons of the actuators have strokes with different lengths and/or different base positions with respect to the caliper.\n\nConcretely, upon braking, the pressurising of the hydraulic circuit, and hence of the hydraulic actuators, moves the pistons of these actuators to the disc depending on the strokes that can be different or from different base positions.

{"id":1,"locId":1,"passage":"As a result with a hydraulic caliper, an asymmetric wear compensation of the pads is naturally made: irrespective of the thicknesses of the pads, both are necessarily pressed against the braking disc as soon as the hydraulic circuit is pressurised.\n\nWith an electromechanical type caliper, it is a same motor which drives both electromechanical actuators, through a transmission mechanism, such that they move the disc pistons closer to each other in order to press the pads on the disc to achieve braking effect.\n\nIf the mechanism ensures a direct type transmission, the movements and base positions of both pistons are necessarily the same when the motor drives the actuators. A thickness deviation of the pads resulting from an asymmetric wear could thereby not be compensated for, because the pistons driven by the motor are necessarily moved by the same stroke when the motor is supplied.\n\nThe purpose of the invention is to provide a mechanical transmission architecture ensuring an asymmetric wear compensation in a brake having a caliper comprising two mechanical actuators driven by a same electric motor.\n\nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n","annotation":"lez?
