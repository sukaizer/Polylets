{"id":0,"locId":0,"passage":"This study investigates dynamic 3D target acquisition. The focus is on the relative effect of specific perceptual cues. A novel technique is introduced and we report on an experiment that evaluates its effectiveness. There are two aspects to the new technique. First, in contrast to normal practice, the tracking symbol is a volume rather than a point. Second, the surface of this volume is semi-transparent, thereby affording occlusion cues during target acquisition. The experiment shows that the volumehcclusioneffective in both monocular and stereoscopic conditions. For some tasks where stereoscopic presentation is unavailable or infeasible, the new techniaue offers an effective alternative.\n\nKeywords : Dsemi-transparency, translucency, partial occlusion, stereopsis, depth perception, 3D interfaces.\n\n","annotation":"lel","fileId":0,"startIndex":"8,0","endIndex":"11","startOffset":1,"endOffset":0,"yPosition":0,"_id":"0vUxLv3fMDWJwPZ8"}
