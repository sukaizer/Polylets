A thickness deviation of the pads resulting from an asymmetric wear could thereby not be compensated for, because the pistons driven by the motor are necessarily moved by the same stroke when the motor is supplied.</p><p>The purpose of the invention is to provide a mechanical transmission architecture ensuring an asymmetric wear compensation in a brake having a caliper comprising two mechanical actuators driven by a same electric motor.</p><h1 id=\"disclosure-of-the-invention\">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</h1><p>To that end, the invention relates to a brake caliper of an automobile vehicle for overlapping an outer edge of a braking disc, this caliper comprising a first pad and a second pad for being on either side of the disc to be pressed against this disc, as well as:</p><p>–&nbsp;a first mechanical actuator including a first movable piston and a first primary toothed wheel, the first piston resting on the first pad to press it against the disc by rotating the first primary toothed wheel;</p><p>–&nbsp;a second mechanical actuator including a second movable piston and a second primary toothed wheel, the second piston resting on the second pad to press it against the disc by rotating the second primary toothed wheel;</p><p>–&nbsp;a rotary shaft including a first worm gear and a second worm gear having a winding direction opposite to that of the first worm gear, the driving shaft being translationally movable along its own longitudinal direction;</p><p>–&nbsp;an electric motor for driving the rotary shaft;</p><p>and wherein the first worm gear is meshed in the first primary toothed wheel, and the second worm gear is meshed in the second primary toothed wheel.</p><p>With this arrangement, when one of the pads comes to contact the disc, the primary wheel of the corresponding actuator becomes stationary, but the rotary shaft continues to rotate by being translated to move the actuator of the other pad until it comes in contact with the disc. The mechanism thus compensates for any asymmetric wear of the pads by ensuring that the two pads with different thicknesses both rest on the disc when the rotary shaft is moved.</p><p>The invention also relates to a caliper thus defined, wherein the first and the second primary toothed wheel rotate about axes parallel to each other and perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the rotary shaft.</p><p>The invention also relates to a caliper thus defined, wherein each actuator includes a driving toothed wheel connected to the corresponding piston by a helical connection, and a gear train through which the driving toothed wheel is movably connected to one of the worm gears of the rotary shaft.</p><p>The invention also relates to a caliper thus defined, wherein the gear train of each actuator includes the primary toothed wheel of this actuator as well as a secondary toothed wheel meshed in the primary toothed wheel and in oblique circumferential teeth of the driving toothed wheel.</p><p>The invention also relates to a brake for an automobile vehicle, comprising a caliper thus defined, as well as a braking disc.</p><h1 id=\"brief-description-of-the-drawings\">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</h1><p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;1 is a transverse cross-section view of a brake according to the invention showing a disc portion and the caliper when the outer pad is more strongly worn than the inner pad;</p><p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;2 is a front view of the mechanism according to the invention showing its transmission and its actuators when the brake is completely released;</p><p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;3 is a rear view of the mechanism according to the invention showing its transmission and its actuators when the brake is applied.</p><h1 id=\"detailed-disclosure-of-particular-embodiments\">DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</h1><p>The brake according to the invention which is marked as 1 in Fig.&nbsp;1 includes a disc&nbsp;2 overlapped by a caliper&nbsp;3 which includes a first lateral portion&nbsp;4 by which it is carried by a chassis element not represented, and a second side portion&nbsp;6, located opposite to the first portion&nbsp;4. The caliper overlaps the disc&nbsp;2 such that this disc is sandwiched between its side portions&nbsp;4 and 6.</p><p>The first portion&nbsp;4 carries a first friction pad&nbsp;7 as well as a first mechanical actuator&nbsp;8 to press this pad against a face of the disc&nbsp;2. Analogously, the second portion&nbsp;6 carries a second friction pad&nbsp;9, and a second mechanical actuator&nbsp;11 to press this second pad against the disc, when the brake is controlled.</p><p>The first actuator&nbsp;8 includes a driving member in the form of a toothed wheel&nbsp;12 comprising a hub forming a nut in which a screw&nbsp;29 is disposed, the end of which directed to the disc&nbsp;2 carries a head, for example a conical head&nbsp;30, resting on the bottom of the piston&nbsp;13. The piston&nbsp;13 is translationally movable along the axis&nbsp;AX, in a chamber or jacket of the first portion&nbsp;4 of the caliper, by being rotatably blocked about this axis&nbsp;AX, for example by a radial stud.</p><p>When the wheel&nbsp;12 is rotatably driven about the axis&nbsp;AX, it causes the piston&nbsp;13 to be thereby moved along this axis, in either direction along the axis&nbsp;AX, along the direction of rotation of this wheel&nbsp;12 about the axis&nbsp;AX.</p><p>In the same way, the second actuator&nbsp;6 includes a driving toothed wheel&nbsp;14 and a piston&nbsp;16 along the axis&nbsp;AX, to move the piston&nbsp;16 along the axis&nbsp;AX when the wheel&nbsp;14 is rotated.</p><p>When the brake is new, both pads&nbsp;7 and 9 have the same thickness, but these thicknesses become different, in view of the wear of these pads over time, which can be asymmetric. Thus, in the example of Fig.&nbsp;1, the second pad, that is the pad&nbsp;9 has a thickness much lower than the first pad, that is the pad&nbsp;7.</p><p>Generally, the asymmetry in wear is not foreseeable, such that it is on the contrary the second pad&nbsp;9 which has a thickness much higher than the first pad&nbsp;7.</p><p>The mechanical actuators&nbsp;8 and 11 have their driving wheels&nbsp;12, 14 which are rotatably driven by a same motor marked as M, through a transmission assembly marked as 17 in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3.</p><p>The transmission assembly&nbsp;17 includes on the one hand a driving shaft or axis&nbsp;18, with an orientation parallel to the axis&nbsp;AX, and which is coupled to the motor&nbsp;M advantageously by a gear reducer not represented to be rotated by the same, while preserving a translation degree of freedom along the axis&nbsp;AX with respect to the motor and the frame of the brake caliper.</p><p>This shaft&nbsp;18 carries a first worm gear&nbsp;19 located at the first actuator&nbsp;8 to rotatably drive the first driving wheel&nbsp;12, and a second worm gear&nbsp;21 located at the second actuator&nbsp;11 to rotatably drive the second wheel&nbsp;14, both these worm gears&nbsp;19, 21 being rigidly integral with the shaft&nbsp;18 carrying them.</p><p>The first worm gear&nbsp;19 is engaged in a primary toothed wheel&nbsp;22 of a first gear train&nbsp;23 of the first actuator&nbsp;8, this primary wheel&nbsp;22 being itself meshed with a secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;24 of this first gear train&nbsp;23. This secondary wheel&nbsp;24 is besides meshed with oblique teeth of the periphery of the first toothed wheel&nbsp;12 of the first actuator&nbsp;8.</p><p>In practice, when the shaft&nbsp;18 rotates by being driven by the motor&nbsp;M, its first worm gear&nbsp;19 rotatably drives the toothed wheel&nbsp;12 through the first gear train&nbsp;23 which makes up a gear reducer.</p><p>Analogously, the second worm gear&nbsp;21 is engaged in another primary toothed wheel&nbsp;26 of a second gear train&nbsp;27 of the second actuator&nbsp;11, which is itself meshed with another secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;28 engaged in peripheral oblique teeth of the second toothed wheel&nbsp;14.</p><p>Thus, when the shaft&nbsp;18 rotates, its second worm gear&nbsp;21 drives the second driving wheel&nbsp;14 via the second gear train&nbsp;27 which makes up another gear reducer.</p><p>As is visible in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3, the axes of rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 and of the driving wheels&nbsp;12 and 14 are parallel to the axis&nbsp;AX, whereas on the contrary, the axes of rotation of all the toothed wheels of the first and second gear trains are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axis&nbsp;AX.</p><p>Besides, the threads of the first and of the second worm gears are in reverse directions: the first worm gear&nbsp;19 is backside threaded, whereas the second screw&nbsp;21 is face threaded, such that a rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 in a first direction of rotation causes whereas a rotation in a second direction of rotation causes them other to be diverted.</p><p>When the shaft&nbsp;18 is rotatably driven in the reverse direction marked as IND in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3, the first worm gear&nbsp;19 drives the primary wheel&nbsp;22 in the forward direction which itself drives the secondary wheel&nbsp;24 in the reverse direction. The secondary wheel&nbsp;24 thereby drives the second driving wheel&nbsp;12 in the forward direction, which causes the piston&nbsp;13 to come out.</p><p>As the second worm gear&nbsp;21 has a thread in the reverse direction as that of the first gear&nbsp;19, this same rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 in the reverse direction analogously causes a rotation of the second driving wheel&nbsp;14 but in the reverse direction, this also causes the second piston to come out, because in particular these pistons are facing each other.</p><p>When the brake is controlled to press the pads on the disc, the pad carried by either of these pistons comes to rest on the braking disc before the other one, which makes the piston carrying it stationary, as well as the primary wheel of the gear train of this piston.</p><p>The shaft&nbsp;18 continues to rotate, but the worm gear driving the piston carrying the pad which is already resting on the disc is meshed in the corresponding primary wheel which is blocked in position. Since this primary wheel is blocked, the rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 causes the simultaneous translation of this shaft along the direction of its length. Under these conditions, the piston carrying the pad which is not still in contact with the disc continues to come out under the effect of the rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 and of the worm gear associated with this piston.</p><p>Once the other pad comes to rest on the disc, the piston carrying it becomes stationary, and likewise, the primary wheel corresponding to the gear train driving this piston is blocked, such that the shaft&nbsp;18 also becomes stationary because it is rotatably blocked by both primary wheels&nbsp;22 and 26.</p><p>As is understood, the brake according to the invention naturally enables an asymmetric wear of both pads to be compensated for since it ensures that a first pad comes to rest to the disc, the other pad continues to be moved until it comes in turn to rest on the disc with the desired force. In the description above, the operation of the brake according to the invention has been explained in terms of movement of its components in order to facilitate comprehension thereof, with the proviso that in practice, the movements have reliable amplitudes and these are mainly forces which are transmitted by the different components.</p><p>In the description above, the rotary shaft drives two simple actuators located on either side of the disc, but an analogous system in which the rotary shaft drives two multiple actuators located on either side of the disc, and each including several movable pistons moved by as many driving wheels does not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p><p>Besides, in the example of the figures, each worm gear drives the driving wheel of the corresponding actuator through a primary wheel and a secondary wheel rotating about axes perpendicular to the axis of the shaft. Of course, a primary wheel with oblique teeth, meshed in the worm gear and in the driving wheel, this primary wheel with oblique teeth thereby rotating about an axis oriented 45° with respect to the rotary shaft does not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p><p>Nomenclature:</p><p>1: brake</p><p>2: disc</p><p>3: caliper</p><p>4: first portion</p><p>6: second portion</p><p>7: first pad</p><p>8: first actuator</p><p>9: second pad</p><p>11: second actuator</p><p>12: first driving wheel</p><p>13: first piston</p><p>14: second driving wheel</p><p>16: second piston</p><p>17: transmission assembly</p><p>18: driving shaft or axis</p><p>19: first worm gear</p><p>21: second worm gear</p><p>22: primary toothed wheel</p><p>23: first gear train</p><p>24: secondary toothed wheel</p><p>26: other primary toothed wheel</p><p>27: second gear train</p><p>28: other secondary toothed wheel</p><p>AX: axis</p><p>IND: reverse direction</p><p>M: motor</p><h1 id=\"claims\">CLAIMS</h1><p>1.&nbsp;A brake caliper&nbsp;(3) of an automobile vehicle, for overlapping an outer edge of a braking disc&nbsp;(2), this caliper comprising a first pad&nbsp;(7) and a second pad&nbsp;(9) for being on either side of the disc&nbsp;(2) to be pressed against this disc&nbsp;(2), as well as:</p><p>–&nbsp;a first mechanical actuator&nbsp;(8) including a first movable piston&nbsp;(13) and a first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22), the first piston&nbsp;(13) resting on the first pad&nbsp;(7) to press it against the disc by rotating the first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22);</p><p>–&nbsp;a second mechanical actuator&nbsp;(11) including a second movable piston&nbsp;(16) and a second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26), the second piston&nbsp;(16) resting on the second pad&nbsp;(9) to press it against the disc by rotating the second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26);</p><p>–&nbsp;a rotary shaft&nbsp;(18) including a first worm gear&nbsp;(19) and a second worm gear&nbsp;(21) having a winding direction opposite to that of the first worm gear&nbsp;(19), the driving shaft&nbsp;(18) being translationally movable along its own longitudinal direction;</p><p>–&nbsp;an electric motor&nbsp;(M) for driving the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18);</p><p>and wherein the first worm gear&nbsp;(19) is meshed in the first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22), and the second worm gear&nbsp;(21) is meshed in the second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26).</p><p>2.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;1, wherein the first and the second primary toothed wheel rotate about axes parallel to each other and perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18).</p><p>3.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;1 or 2, wherein each actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) includes a driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14) connected to the corresponding piston&nbsp;(13, 16) by a helical connection, and a gear train&nbsp;(23, 27) through which the driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14) is movably connected to one of the worm gears of the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18).</p><p>4.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;3, wherein the gear train&nbsp;(23, 27) of each actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) includes the primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22, 26) of this actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) as well as a secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;(24, 28) meshed in the primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22, 26) and in oblique circumferential teeth of the driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14).</p><p>5.&nbsp;A brake for an automobile vehicle, comprising a caliper according to one of the preceding claims, as well as a braking disc&nbsp;(2).</p><p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p><p>The invention relates to a brake comprising:</p><p>-&nbsp;a caliper overlapping a disk;</p><p>-&nbsp;a first pad and a second pad (7, 9) which are carried by the caliper (3) on either side of the disk (2);</p><p>-&nbsp;a first actuator (8) including a first primary toothed wheel (22) driving a first mobile piston (13) pressing against the first pad (7) in order to move same;</p><p>-&nbsp;a second actuator (11) including a second primary toothed wheel (26) driving a second mobile piston (16) pressing against the second pad (9);</p><p>-&nbsp;a rotating shaft (18) comprising a first and a second endless screw (19, 21) having opposite winding directions, the shaft (18) being movable in translation; and</p><p>-&nbsp;an electric motor (M) for driving the rotating shaft (18);</p><p>and in which the first and second endless screws (19, 21) are engaged in the first and second primary toothed wheels (22, 26) respectively.</p><p>FIG. 2.</p>","_id":"LgV7Zl7V8ry93uSJ"}

The caliper overlaps the disc&nbsp;2 such that this disc is sandwiched between its side portions&nbsp;4 and 6.</p><p>The first portion&nbsp;4 carries a first friction pad&nbsp;7 as well as a first mechanical actuator&nbsp;8 to press this pad against a face of the disc&nbsp;2. Analogously, the second portion&nbsp;6 carries a second friction pad&nbsp;9, and a second mechanical actuator&nbsp;11 to press this second pad against the disc, when the brake is controlled.</p><p>The first actuator&nbsp;8 includes a driving member in the form of a toothed wheel&nbsp;12 comprising a hub forming a nut in which a screw&nbsp;29 is disposed, the end of which directed to the disc&nbsp;2 carries a head, for example a conical head&nbsp;30, resting on the bottom of the piston&nbsp;13. The piston&nbsp;13 is translationally movable along the axis&nbsp;AX, in a chamber or jacket of the first portion&nbsp;4 of the caliper, by being rotatably blocked about this axis&nbsp;AX, for example by a radial stud.</p><p>When the wheel&nbsp;12 is rotatably driven about the axis&nbsp;AX, it causes the piston&nbsp;13 to be thereby moved along this axis, in either direction along the axis&nbsp;AX, along the direction of rotation of this wheel&nbsp;12 about the axis&nbsp;AX.</p><p>In the same way, the second actuator&nbsp;6 includes a driving toothed wheel&nbsp;14 and a piston&nbsp;16 along the axis&nbsp;AX, to move the piston&nbsp;16 along the axis&nbsp;AX when the wheel&nbsp;14 is rotated.</p><p>When the brake is new, both pads&nbsp;7 and 9 have the same thickness, but these thicknesses become different, in view of the wear of these pads over time, which can be asymmetric. Thus, in the example of Fig.&nbsp;1, the second pad, that is the pad&nbsp;9 has a thickness much lower than the first pad, that is the pad&nbsp;7.</p><p>Generally, the asymmetry in wear is not foreseeable, such that it is on the contrary the second pad&nbsp;9 which has a thickness much higher than the first pad&nbsp;7.</p><p>The mechanical actuators&nbsp;8 and 11 have their driving wheels&nbsp;12, 14 which are rotatably driven by a same motor marked as M, through a transmission assembly marked as 17 in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3.</p><p>The transmission assembly&nbsp;17 includes on the one hand a driving shaft or axis&nbsp;18, with an orientation parallel to the axis&nbsp;AX, and which is coupled to the motor&nbsp;M advantageously by a gear reducer not represented to be rotated by the same, while preserving a translation degree of freedom along the axis&nbsp;AX with respect to the motor and the frame of the brake caliper.</p><p>This shaft&nbsp;18 carries a first worm gear&nbsp;19 located at the first actuator&nbsp;8 to rotatably drive the first driving wheel&nbsp;12, and a second worm gear&nbsp;21 located at the second actuator&nbsp;11 to rotatably drive the second wheel&nbsp;14, both these worm gears&nbsp;19, 21 being rigidly integral with the shaft&nbsp;18 carrying them.</p><p>The first worm gear&nbsp;19 is engaged in a primary toothed wheel&nbsp;22 of a first gear train&nbsp;23 of the first actuator&nbsp;8, this primary wheel&nbsp;22 being itself meshed with a secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;24 of this first gear train&nbsp;23. This secondary wheel&nbsp;24 is besides meshed with oblique teeth of the periphery of the first toothed wheel&nbsp;12 of the first actuator&nbsp;8.</p><p>In practice, when the shaft&nbsp;18 rotates by being driven by the motor&nbsp;M, its first worm gear&nbsp;19 rotatably drives the toothed wheel&nbsp;12 through the first gear train&nbsp;23 which makes up a gear reducer.</p><p>Analogously, the second worm gear&nbsp;21 is engaged in another primary toothed wheel&nbsp;26 of a second gear train&nbsp;27 of the second actuator&nbsp;11, which is itself meshed with another secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;28 engaged in peripheral oblique teeth of the second toothed wheel&nbsp;14.</p><p>Thus, when the shaft&nbsp;18 rotates, its second worm gear&nbsp;21 drives the second driving wheel&nbsp;14 via the second gear train&nbsp;27 which makes up another gear reducer.</p><p>As is visible in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3, the axes of rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 and of the driving wheels&nbsp;12 and 14 are parallel to the axis&nbsp;AX, whereas on the contrary, the axes of rotation of all the toothed wheels of the first and second gear trains are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axis&nbsp;AX.</p><p>Besides, the threads of the first and of the second worm gears are in reverse directions: the first worm gear&nbsp;19 is backside threaded, whereas the second screw&nbsp;21 is face threaded, such that a rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 in a first direction of rotation causes whereas a rotation in a second direction of rotation causes them other to be diverted.</p><p>When the shaft&nbsp;18 is rotatably driven in the reverse direction marked as IND in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3, the first worm gear&nbsp;19 drives the primary wheel&nbsp;22 in the forward direction which itself drives the secondary wheel&nbsp;24 in the reverse direction. The secondary wheel&nbsp;24 thereby drives the second driving wheel&nbsp;12 in the forward direction, which causes the piston&nbsp;13 to come out.</p><p>As the second worm gear&nbsp;21 has a thread in the reverse direction as that of the first gear&nbsp;19, this same rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 in the reverse direction analogously causes a rotation of the second driving wheel&nbsp;14 but in the reverse direction, this also causes the second piston to come out, because in particular these pistons are facing each other.</p><p>When the brake is controlled to press the pads on the disc, the pad carried by either of these pistons comes to rest on the braking disc before the other one, which makes the piston carrying it stationary, as well as the primary wheel of the gear train of this piston.</p><p>The shaft&nbsp;18 continues to rotate, but the worm gear driving the piston carrying the pad which is already resting on the disc is meshed in the corresponding primary wheel which is blocked in position. Since this primary wheel is blocked, the rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 causes the simultaneous translation of this shaft along the direction of its length. Under these conditions, the piston carrying the pad which is not still in contact with the disc continues to come out under the effect of the rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 and of the worm gear associated with this piston.</p><p>Once the other pad comes to rest on the disc, the piston carrying it becomes stationary, and likewise, the primary wheel corresponding to the gear train driving this piston is blocked, such that the shaft&nbsp;18 also becomes stationary because it is rotatably blocked by both primary wheels&nbsp;22 and 26.</p><p>As is understood, the brake according to the invention naturally enables an asymmetric wear of both pads to be compensated for since it ensures that a first pad comes to rest to the disc, the other pad continues to be moved until it comes in turn to rest on the disc with the desired force. In the description above, the operation of the brake according to the invention has been explained in terms of movement of its components in order to facilitate comprehension thereof, with the proviso that in practice, the movements have reliable amplitudes and these are mainly forces which are transmitted by the different components.</p><p>In the description above, the rotary shaft drives two simple actuators located on either side of the disc, but an analogous system in which the rotary shaft drives two multiple actuators located on either side of the disc, and each including several movable pistons moved by as many driving wheels does not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p><p>Besides, in the example of the figures, each worm gear drives the driving wheel of the corresponding actuator through a primary wheel and a secondary wheel rotating about axes perpendicular to the axis of the shaft. Of course, a primary wheel with oblique teeth, meshed in the worm gear and in the driving wheel, this primary wheel with oblique teeth thereby rotating about an axis oriented 45° with respect to the rotary shaft does not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p><p>Nomenclature:</p><p>1: brake</p><p>2: disc</p><p>3: caliper</p><p>4: first portion</p><p>6: second portion</p><p>7: first pad</p><p>8: first actuator</p><p>9: second pad</p><p>11: second actuator</p><p>12: first driving wheel</p><p>13: first piston</p><p>14: second driving wheel</p><p>16: second piston</p><p>17: transmission assembly</p><p>18: driving shaft or axis</p><p>19: first worm gear</p><p>21: second worm gear</p><p>22: primary toothed wheel</p><p>23: first gear train</p><p>24: secondary toothed wheel</p><p>26: other primary toothed wheel</p><p>27: second gear train</p><p>28: other secondary toothed wheel</p><p>AX: axis</p><p>IND: reverse direction</p><p>M: motor</p><h1 id=\"claims\">CLAIMS</h1><p>1.&nbsp;A brake caliper&nbsp;(3) of an automobile vehicle, for overlapping an outer edge of a braking disc&nbsp;(2), this caliper comprising a first pad&nbsp;(7) and a second pad&nbsp;(9) for being on either side of the disc&nbsp;(2) to be pressed against this disc&nbsp;(2), as well as:</p><p>–&nbsp;a first mechanical actuator&nbsp;(8) including a first movable piston&nbsp;(13) and a first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22), the first piston&nbsp;(13) resting on the first pad&nbsp;(7) to press it against the disc by rotating the first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22);</p><p>–&nbsp;a second mechanical actuator&nbsp;(11) including a second movable piston&nbsp;(16) and a second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26), the second piston&nbsp;(16) resting on the second pad&nbsp;(9) to press it against the disc by rotating the second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26);</p><p>–&nbsp;a rotary shaft&nbsp;(18) including a first worm gear&nbsp;(19) and a second worm gear&nbsp;(21) having a winding direction opposite to that of the first worm gear&nbsp;(19), the driving shaft&nbsp;(18) being translationally movable along its own longitudinal direction;</p><p>–&nbsp;an electric motor&nbsp;(M) for driving the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18);</p><p>and wherein the first worm gear&nbsp;(19) is meshed in the first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22), and the second worm gear&nbsp;(21) is meshed in the second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26).</p><p>2.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;1, wherein the first and the second primary toothed wheel rotate about axes parallel to each other and perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18).</p><p>3.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;1 or 2, wherein each actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) includes a driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14) connected to the corresponding piston&nbsp;(13, 16) by a helical connection, and a gear train&nbsp;(23, 27) through which the driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14) is movably connected to one of the worm gears of the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18).</p><p>4.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;3, wherein the gear train&nbsp;(23, 27) of each actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) includes the primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22, 26) of this actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) as well as a secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;(24, 28) meshed in the primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22, 26) and in oblique circumferential teeth of the driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14).</p><p>5.&nbsp;A brake for an automobile vehicle, comprising a caliper according to one of the preceding claims, as well as a braking disc&nbsp;(2).</p><p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p><p>The invention relates to a brake comprising:</p><p>-&nbsp;a caliper overlapping a disk;</p><p>-&nbsp;a first pad and a second pad (7, 9) which are carried by the caliper (3) on either side of the disk (2);</p><p>-&nbsp;a first actuator (8) including a first primary toothed wheel (22) driving a first mobile piston (13) pressing against the first pad (7) in order to move same;</p><p>-&nbsp;a second actuator (11) including a second primary toothed wheel (26) driving a second mobile piston (16) pressing against the second pad (9);</p><p>-&nbsp;a rotating shaft (18) comprising a first and a second endless screw (19, 21) having opposite winding directions, the shaft (18) being movable in translation; and</p><p>-&nbsp;an electric motor (M) for driving the rotating shaft (18);</p><p>and in which the first and second endless screws (19, 21) are engaged in the first and second primary toothed wheels (22, 26) respectively.</p><p>FIG. 2.</p>","_id":"Zf6dmOCBRnQhVbiB"}

With such a circuit, the operation corresponds to that of a force control, which hence enables that the pistons of the actuators have strokes with different lengths and/or different base positions with respect to the caliper.</p><p>Concretely, upon braking, the pressurising of the hydraulic circuit, and hence of the hydraulic actuators, moves the pistons of these actuators to the disc depending on the strokes that can be different or from different base positions. This movement is operated until the pistons press the pads against the disc, the pressure remaining identical in the circuit and in the actuators in any circumstance.</p><p>As a result with a hydraulic caliper, an asymmetric wear compensation of the pads is naturally made: irrespective of the thicknesses of the pads, both are necessarily pressed against the braking disc as soon as the hydraulic circuit is pressurised.</p><p>With an electromechanical type caliper, it is a same motor which drives both electromechanical actuators, through a transmission mechanism, such that they move the disc pistons closer to each other in order to press the pads on the disc to achieve braking effect.</p><p>If the mechanism ensures a direct type transmission, the movements and base positions of both pistons are necessarily the same when the motor drives the actuators. A thickness deviation of the pads resulting from an asymmetric wear could thereby not be compensated for, because the pistons driven by the motor are necessarily moved by the same stroke when the motor is supplied.</p><p>The purpose of the invention is to provide a mechanical transmission architecture ensuring an asymmetric wear compensation in a brake having a caliper comprising two mechanical actuators driven by a same electric motor.</p><h1 id=\"disclosure-of-the-invention\">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</h1><p>To that end, the invention relates to a brake caliper of an automobile vehicle for overlapping an outer edge of a braking disc, this caliper comprising a first pad and a second pad for being on either side of the disc to be pressed against this disc, as well as:</p><p>–&nbsp;a first mechanical actuator including a first movable piston and a first primary toothed wheel, the first piston resting on the first pad to press it against the disc by rotating the first primary toothed wheel;</p><p>–&nbsp;a second mechanical actuator including a second movable piston and a second primary toothed wheel, the second piston resting on the second pad to press it against the disc by rotating the second primary toothed wheel;</p><p>–&nbsp;a rotary shaft including a first worm gear and a second worm gear having a winding direction opposite to that of the first worm gear, the driving shaft being translationally movable along its own longitudinal direction;</p><p>–&nbsp;an electric motor for driving the rotary shaft;</p><p>and wherein the first worm gear is meshed in the first primary toothed wheel, and the second worm gear is meshed in the second primary toothed wheel.</p><p>With this arrangement, when one of the pads comes to contact the disc, the primary wheel of the corresponding actuator becomes stationary, but the rotary shaft continues to rotate by being translated to move the actuator of the other pad until it comes in contact with the disc. The mechanism thus compensates for any asymmetric wear of the pads by ensuring that the two pads with different thicknesses both rest on the disc when the rotary shaft is moved.</p><p>The invention also relates to a caliper thus defined, wherein the first and the second primary toothed wheel rotate about axes parallel to each other and perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the rotary shaft.</p><p>The invention also relates to a caliper thus defined, wherein each actuator includes a driving toothed wheel connected to the corresponding piston by a helical connection, and a gear train through which the driving toothed wheel is movably connected to one of the worm gears of the rotary shaft.</p><p>The invention also relates to a caliper thus defined, wherein the gear train of each actuator includes the primary toothed wheel of this actuator as well as a secondary toothed wheel meshed in the primary toothed wheel and in oblique circumferential teeth of the driving toothed wheel.</p><p>The invention also relates to a brake for an automobile vehicle, comprising a caliper thus defined, as well as a braking disc.</p><h1 id=\"brief-description-of-the-drawings\">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</h1><p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;1 is a transverse cross-section view of a brake according to the invention showing a disc portion and the caliper when the outer pad is more strongly worn than the inner pad;</p><p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;2 is a front view of the mechanism according to the invention showing its transmission and its actuators when the brake is completely released;</p><p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;3 is a rear view of the mechanism according to the invention showing its transmission and its actuators when the brake is applied.</p><h1 id=\"detailed-disclosure-of-particular-embodiments\">DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</h1><p>The brake according to the invention which is marked as 1 in Fig.&nbsp;1 includes a disc&nbsp;2 overlapped by a caliper&nbsp;3 which includes a first lateral portion&nbsp;4 by which it is carried by a chassis element not represented, and a second side portion&nbsp;6, located opposite to the first portion&nbsp;4. The caliper overlaps the disc&nbsp;2 such that this disc is sandwiched between its side portions&nbsp;4 and 6.</p><p>The first portion&nbsp;4 carries a first friction pad&nbsp;7 as well as a first mechanical actuator&nbsp;8 to press this pad against a face of the disc&nbsp;2. Analogously, the second portion&nbsp;6 carries a second friction pad&nbsp;9, and a second mechanical actuator&nbsp;11 to press this second pad against the disc, when the brake is controlled.</p><p>The first actuator&nbsp;8 includes a driving member in the form of a toothed wheel&nbsp;12 comprising a hub forming a nut in which a screw&nbsp;29 is disposed, the end of which directed to the disc&nbsp;2 carries a head, for example a conical head&nbsp;30, resting on the bottom of the piston&nbsp;13. The piston&nbsp;13 is translationally movable along the axis&nbsp;AX, in a chamber or jacket of the first portion&nbsp;4 of the caliper, by being rotatably blocked about this axis&nbsp;AX, for example by a radial stud.</p><p>When the wheel&nbsp;12 is rotatably driven about the axis&nbsp;AX, it causes the piston&nbsp;13 to be thereby moved along this axis, in either direction along the axis&nbsp;AX, along the direction of rotation of this wheel&nbsp;12 about the axis&nbsp;AX.</p><p>In the same way, the second actuator&nbsp;6 includes a driving toothed wheel&nbsp;14 and a piston&nbsp;16 along the axis&nbsp;AX, to move the piston&nbsp;16 along the axis&nbsp;AX when the wheel&nbsp;14 is rotated.</p><p>When the brake is new, both pads&nbsp;7 and 9 have the same thickness, but these thicknesses become different, in view of the wear of these pads over time, which can be asymmetric. Thus, in the example of Fig.&nbsp;1, the second pad, that is the pad&nbsp;9 has a thickness much lower than the first pad, that is the pad&nbsp;7.</p><p>Generally, the asymmetry in wear is not foreseeable, such that it is on the contrary the second pad&nbsp;9 which has a thickness much higher than the first pad&nbsp;7.</p><p>The mechanical actuators&nbsp;8 and 11 have their driving wheels&nbsp;12, 14 which are rotatably driven by a same motor marked as M, through a transmission assembly marked as 17 in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3.</p><p>The transmission assembly&nbsp;17 includes on the one hand a driving shaft or axis&nbsp;18, with an orientation parallel to the axis&nbsp;AX, and which is coupled to the motor&nbsp;M advantageously by a gear reducer not represented to be rotated by the same, while preserving a translation degree of freedom along the axis&nbsp;AX with respect to the motor and the frame of the brake caliper.</p><p>This shaft&nbsp;18 carries a first worm gear&nbsp;19 located at the first actuator&nbsp;8 to rotatably drive the first driving wheel&nbsp;12, and a second worm gear&nbsp;21 located at the second actuator&nbsp;11 to rotatably drive the second wheel&nbsp;14, both these worm gears&nbsp;19, 21 being rigidly integral with the shaft&nbsp;18 carrying them.</p><p>The first worm gear&nbsp;19 is engaged in a primary toothed wheel&nbsp;22 of a first gear train&nbsp;23 of the first actuator&nbsp;8, this primary wheel&nbsp;22 being itself meshed with a secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;24 of this first gear train&nbsp;23. This secondary wheel&nbsp;24 is besides meshed with oblique teeth of the periphery of the first toothed wheel&nbsp;12 of the first actuator&nbsp;8.</p><p>In practice, when the shaft&nbsp;18 rotates by being driven by the motor&nbsp;M, its first worm gear&nbsp;19 rotatably drives the toothed wheel&nbsp;12 through the first gear train&nbsp;23 which makes up a gear reducer.</p><p>Analogously, the second worm gear&nbsp;21 is engaged in another primary toothed wheel&nbsp;26 of a second gear train&nbsp;27 of the second actuator&nbsp;11, which is itself meshed with another secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;28 engaged in peripheral oblique teeth of the second toothed wheel&nbsp;14.</p><p>Thus, when the shaft&nbsp;18 rotates, its second worm gear&nbsp;21 drives the second driving wheel&nbsp;14 via the second gear train&nbsp;27 which makes up another gear reducer.</p><p>As is visible in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3, the axes of rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 and of the driving wheels&nbsp;12 and 14 are parallel to the axis&nbsp;AX, whereas on the contrary, the axes of rotation of all the toothed wheels of the first and second gear trains are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axis&nbsp;AX.</p><p>Besides, the threads of the first and of the second worm gears are in reverse directions: the first worm gear&nbsp;19 is backside threaded, whereas the second screw&nbsp;21 is face threaded, such that a rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 in a first direction of rotation causes whereas a rotation in a second direction of rotation causes them other to be diverted.</p><p>When the shaft&nbsp;18 is rotatably driven in the reverse direction marked as IND in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3, the first worm gear&nbsp;19 drives the primary wheel&nbsp;22 in the forward direction which itself drives the secondary wheel&nbsp;24 in the reverse direction. The secondary wheel&nbsp;24 thereby drives the second driving wheel&nbsp;12 in the forward direction, which causes the piston&nbsp;13 to come out.</p><p>As the second worm gear&nbsp;21 has a thread in the reverse direction as that of the first gear&nbsp;19, this same rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 in the reverse direction analogously causes a rotation of the second driving wheel&nbsp;14 but in the reverse direction, this also causes the second piston to come out, because in particular these pistons are facing each other.</p><p>When the brake is controlled to press the pads on the disc, the pad carried by either of these pistons comes to rest on the braking disc before the other one, which makes the piston carrying it stationary, as well as the primary wheel of the gear train of this piston.</p><p>The shaft&nbsp;18 continues to rotate, but the worm gear driving the piston carrying the pad which is already resting on the disc is meshed in the corresponding primary wheel which is blocked in position. Since this primary wheel is blocked, the rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 causes the simultaneous translation of this shaft along the direction of its length. Under these conditions, the piston carrying the pad which is not still in contact with the disc continues to come out under the effect of the rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 and of the worm gear associated with this piston.</p><p>Once the other pad comes to rest on the disc, the piston carrying it becomes stationary, and likewise, the primary wheel corresponding to the gear train driving this piston is blocked, such that the shaft&nbsp;18 also becomes stationary because it is rotatably blocked by both primary wheels&nbsp;22 and 26.</p><p>As is understood, the brake according to the invention naturally enables an asymmetric wear of both pads to be compensated for since it ensures that a first pad comes to rest to the disc, the other pad continues to be moved until it comes in turn to rest on the disc with the desired force. In the description above, the operation of the brake according to the invention has been explained in terms of movement of its components in order to facilitate comprehension thereof, with the proviso that in practice, the movements have reliable amplitudes and these are mainly forces which are transmitted by the different components.</p><p>In the description above, the rotary shaft drives two simple actuators located on either side of the disc, but an analogous system in which the rotary shaft drives two multiple actuators located on either side of the disc, and each including several movable pistons moved by as many driving wheels does not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p><p>Besides, in the example of the figures, each worm gear drives the driving wheel of the corresponding actuator through a primary wheel and a secondary wheel rotating about axes perpendicular to the axis of the shaft. Of course, a primary wheel with oblique teeth, meshed in the worm gear and in the driving wheel, this primary wheel with oblique teeth thereby rotating about an axis oriented 45° with respect to the rotary shaft does not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p><p>Nomenclature:</p><p>1: brake</p><p>2: disc</p><p>3: caliper</p><p>4: first portion</p><p>6: second portion</p><p>7: first pad</p><p>8: first actuator</p><p>9: second pad</p><p>11: second actuator</p><p>12: first driving wheel</p><p>13: first piston</p><p>14: second driving wheel</p><p>16: second piston</p><p>17: transmission assembly</p><p>18: driving shaft or axis</p><p>19: first worm gear</p><p>21: second worm gear</p><p>22: primary toothed wheel</p><p>23: first gear train</p><p>24: secondary toothed wheel</p><p>26: other primary toothed wheel</p><p>27: second gear train</p><p>28: other secondary toothed wheel</p><p>AX: axis</p><p>IND: reverse direction</p><p>M: motor</p><h1 id=\"claims\">CLAIMS</h1><p>1.&nbsp;A brake caliper&nbsp;(3) of an automobile vehicle, for overlapping an outer edge of a braking disc&nbsp;(2), this caliper comprising a first pad&nbsp;(7) and a second pad&nbsp;(9) for being on either side of the disc&nbsp;(2) to be pressed against this disc&nbsp;(2), as well as:</p><p>–&nbsp;a first mechanical actuator&nbsp;(8) including a first movable piston&nbsp;(13) and a first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22), the first piston&nbsp;(13) resting on the first pad&nbsp;(7) to press it against the disc by rotating the first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22);</p><p>–&nbsp;a second mechanical actuator&nbsp;(11) including a second movable piston&nbsp;(16) and a second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26), the second piston&nbsp;(16) resting on the second pad&nbsp;(9) to press it against the disc by rotating the second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26);</p><p>–&nbsp;a rotary shaft&nbsp;(18) including a first worm gear&nbsp;(19) and a second worm gear&nbsp;(21) having a winding direction opposite to that of the first worm gear&nbsp;(19), the driving shaft&nbsp;(18) being translationally movable along its own longitudinal direction;</p><p>–&nbsp;an electric motor&nbsp;(M) for driving the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18);</p><p>and wherein the first worm gear&nbsp;(19) is meshed in the first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22), and the second worm gear&nbsp;(21) is meshed in the second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26).</p><p>2.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;1, wherein the first and the second primary toothed wheel rotate about axes parallel to each other and perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18).</p><p>3.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;1 or 2, wherein each actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) includes a driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14) connected to the corresponding piston&nbsp;(13, 16) by a helical connection, and a gear train&nbsp;(23, 27) through which the driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14) is movably connected to one of the worm gears of the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18).</p><p>4.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;3, wherein the gear train&nbsp;(23, 27) of each actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) includes the primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22, 26) of this actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) as well as a secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;(24, 28) meshed in the primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22, 26) and in oblique circumferential teeth of the driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14).</p><p>5.&nbsp;A brake for an automobile vehicle, comprising a caliper according to one of the preceding claims, as well as a braking disc&nbsp;(2).</p><p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p><p>The invention relates to a brake comprising:</p><p>-&nbsp;a caliper overlapping a disk;</p><p>-&nbsp;a first pad and a second pad (7, 9) which are carried by the caliper (3) on either side of the disk (2);</p><p>-&nbsp;a first actuator (8) including a first primary toothed wheel (22) driving a first mobile piston (13) pressing against the first pad (7) in order to move same;</p><p>-&nbsp;a second actuator (11) including a second primary toothed wheel (26) driving a second mobile piston (16) pressing against the second pad (9);</p><p>-&nbsp;a rotating shaft (18) comprising a first and a second endless screw (19, 21) having opposite winding directions, the shaft (18) being movable in translation; and</p><p>-&nbsp;an electric motor (M) for driving the rotating shaft (18);</p><p>and in which the first and second endless screws (19, 21) are engaged in the first and second primary toothed wheels (22, 26) respectively.</p><p>FIG. 2.</p>","_id":"eiKIQOw5a2HPJpqv"}
