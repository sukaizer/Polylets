As regards the secondary flow, it is propelled directly rearwardly by the fan to generate further thrust.\n\nThe expansion in the turbines 8, which enables the compressor 4, 6 and the fan 6 to be driven, occurs at a high temperature because it occurs immediately after combustion. This turbine 8 is thus designed and dimensioned to operate under harsh temperature, pressure and fluid flow rate conditions.\n\nEach turbine includes a succession of stages each including a series of vanes evenly spaced about the driving shaft, the vanes which are subjected to the harshest conditions being those of the first expansion stages, called high pressure stages.\n\nIncreased performance requirements result in designing engines operating in increasingly har","annotation":"","fileId":3,"startIndex":6,"endIndex":14,"startOffset":11,"endOffset":92,"yPosition":0,"_id":"qVTtszhX2oqcbwZm"}
