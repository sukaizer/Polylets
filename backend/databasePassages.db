Thus, in the example of Fig. 1, the second pad, that is the pad 9 has a thickness much lower than the first pad, that is the pad 7.\n\nGenerally, the asymmetry in wear is not foreseeable, such that it is on the contrary the second pad 9 which has a thickness much higher than the first pad 7.\n\nThe mechanical actuators 8 and 11 have their driving wheels 12, 14 which are rotatably driven by a same motor marked as M, through a transmission","annotation":"","fileId":4,"startIndex":41,"endIndex":43,"startOffset":0,"endOffset":145,"yPosition":1535,"_id":"ZMdk1LV5cy00ZU9O"}

As is visible in Fig. 4, the pressure side parallel to the span direction gives rise to a boundary layer which, unlike the case of the invention, is very close to the closing wall.
