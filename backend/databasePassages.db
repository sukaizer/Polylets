{"id":0,"locId":2,"passage":"In most GUIs, selection is effected by placing the point of the mouse-driven cursor over the area of the object to be selected. Fitts' law is commonly used to model such target acquisition, with the term A representing the amplitude, or distance, of the target from the cursor, and W the width of the target area. As the W term gets smaller, the index of difficulty of the task increases. The extreme case of this is when the target is a point. In this paper, we show that selection in such cases can be facilitated if the cursor is an area, rather than a point. Furthermore, we show that when the target is a point and the width of the cursor is W, that Fitts' law still holds. An experiment is presented and the implications of the technique are discussed for both 2D and 3D interfaces.\n\nKEYWORDS:","annotation":"","fileId":0,"startIndex":"7,0","endIndex":"8,0,0","startOffset":0,"endOffset":9,"yPosition":0,"_id":"S8HmmB3UtKta4fjD"}
