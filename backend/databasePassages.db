We show that the current technique, which we call bitmap pointing (BMP), is often sub-optimal as it requires continuous information from the mouse while the system often just needs the discrete specification of objects. The paper introduces object pointing (OP), a novel interaction technique based on a special screen cursor that skips empty spaces, thus drastically reducing the waste of input information. We report data from 1D and 2D Fitts’ law experiments showing that OP outperforms BMP and that the performance facilitation increases with the task’s index of difficulty. We discuss the implementation of OP in current interfaces.

Drag-and-Pick extends the drag-and-pop interaction style such that it allows activating icons, e.g., to open folders or launch applications. In this paper, we report the results of a user study comparing drag-and-pop with traditional drag-and-drop on a 15’ (4.50m) wide interactive display wall. Participants where able to file icons up to 3.7 times faster when using the drag-and-pop interface.\n\nKeywords\n\n","annotation":"","fileId":0,"startIndex":"7,0","endIndex":"21","startOffset":494,"endOffset":0,"yPosition":0,"_id":"qw4bx1XAoRLGU70f"}
