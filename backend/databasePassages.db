In a service configuration, the aft fairing extends along the prolongation of the forward fairing, the grates then being covered by the forward fairing. In the thrust inversion configuration, displacement of the aft fairing in the aft direction exposes the grates that are then located in the space separating the forward fairing from the aft fairing so that the air flow passes through them and is deviated in the forward direction.\n\nIn general, the travelling grates thrust reverser configuration contributes to reducing the thickness of the pod around most of its circumference, and consequently also the engine drag. Under these conditions, some equipment may not fit inside the reduced thickness of the engine pod and is placed at the pylon by which the engine is suspended from the aircraft wing to take advantage of the fact that the available thickness at the pylon is more than the nominal thickness of the pod.\n\nConsequently, access to the top region of the pod is necessary to be able to work on the equipment positioned at this location. As illustrated on figure 1, considering the large dimensions of such an engine denoted 1, access to the top part 2 of the pod requires the use of a dedicated staircase called access steps, denoted 3, in particular with an upper platform and handrails matching the circular periphery of the engine 1.\n\nThe operator, denoted 4 in figure 1, mus","annotation":"","fileId":2,"startOffset":52,"endOffset":40,"startNode":{},"endNode":{},"_id":"jjALFsL6hFlkFoDg"}
