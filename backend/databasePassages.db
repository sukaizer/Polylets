However, this is information from the system— not to the system. What is occurring at t1 was trivially predictable from t0 because [AB] had to be reached anyway, regardless of whether or not it was the movement’s target. The message emitted by the user over the [t0, t1] interval is essentially redundant.\n\nIn fact, the single bit of information the system has been waiting for since t0 is delivered at time t2, when the cursor crosses the upper boundary of target [AB]: at that moment, the cursor is moving rather fast (i.e., the slope of the trajectory is steep), so there is no doubt that the cursor is leaving the object—the probability that the cursor aims at target [CD] switches to 1.
