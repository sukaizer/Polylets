While drag-and-pop is initiated by the user dragging an icon, drag-and-pick starts with the user performing a drag interaction on empty screen space. The system’s response to this drag interaction is similar to drag-and-pop, but with two differences. First, all icons located in the direction of the drag motion will pop up, not only those of compatible type (Figure 3). Second, as the user drags the mouse cursor over one of the targets and releases the mouse button, the folder, file, or application associated with the icon is activated as if it had been double clicked. Figure 4 shows how this allows users to use the pen for launching an application, the icon of which is located on a monitor not supporting pen input. In principle, drag-and-pick can be applied to any type of widget, e.g., any buttons and menus located on a non-pen accessible monitor. In this paper, however, we will focus on the manipulation of icons.\n\nRelated Work\n\n","annotation":"","fileId":1,"startIndex":"23,0","endIndex":"53","startOffset":26,"endOffset":0,"yPosition":1443,"_id":"IoP5FzRcpNjm3EC5"}
{"id":3,"locId":3,"passage":" interaction techniques, such as drag-and-drop, require users to interact with two or more icons in a single pen-down interaction. If these icons are distributed across physically separate pen/touch input display units, users first have to bring all involved icons to the same display unit, a potentially timeconsuming activity (Figure 2a-c).\n\nScenario 3: Bridging long distances. Accessing icons located far away from the user, e.g., on the opposite side of a 15’ DynaWall, requires users to physically walk over, the time for which may in some circumstances increase linearly with distance (Guiard et at, 2001). In addition, drag interactions get more error-prone with distance, because users drop objects accidentally when failing to continuously keep the pen tip in contact with the display surface (Rekimoto 1997).\n\nDrag-and-pop & drag-and-pick\n\nDrag-and-pop and drag-and-pick are interaction techniques that address these","annotation":"hoy","fileId":1,"startIndex":"15,0","endIndex":"18,0","startOffset":51,"endOffset":76,"yPosition":783,"_id":"YCbIf6iVtHQ4y4Dg"}

The items are listed from top to bottom, sometimes with an index number for each to the item.

Some systems have used the two dimensional nature of the computer display to the advantage of certain menu applications. Many flight simulation programs, for example, lay out directional headings in a typical compass format.\n\n","annotation":"heihi","fileId":0,"startIndex":"11,0","endIndex":"27","startOffset":63,"endOffset":1,"yPosition":0,"_id":"h9jppaAXO7iTRC6t"}
