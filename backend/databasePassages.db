Fitts' law is commonly used to model such target acquisition, with the term A representing the amplitude, or distance, of the target from the cursor, and W the width of the target area. As the W term gets smaller, the index of difficulty of the task increases. The extreme case of this is when the target is a point. In this paper, we show that selection in such cases can be facilitated if the cursor is an area, rather than a point. Furthermore, we show that when the target is a point and the width of the cursor is W, that Fitts' law still holds. An experiment is presented and the implications of the technique are discussed for both 2D and 3D interfaces.\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nInput techniques, graphical user interfaces, Fitts' law, haptic input.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAlthough the traditional method of selection in direct- manipulation systems is","annotation":"hello there","fileId":0,"startIndex":7,"endIndex":11,"startOffset":38,"endOffset":79,"yPosition":0,"_id":"4fe8s8ZvTWhxWTMB"}

Figure 2 illustrates the approach using an area cursor, as well as the traditional approach\n\nIn what follows, we report on an experiment that demonstrates the applicability of Fitts' law to selecting point targets with an area cursor. We follow this with a discussion of the design implications of our findings to other 2D and 3D tasks.\n\nFinally, due to the similarity of their benefits, we name the use of area cursors after the first manufacturer of oversized tennis rackets: the Prince technique\n\nTHE EXPERIMENT\n\nSubjects","annotation":"note","fileId":0,"startIndex":15,"endIndex":20,"startOffset":340,"endOffset":8,"yPosition":462,"_id":"LTGPlPCTNQTAeumo"}

In our design, gain was constant until the velocity of the cursor dropped to 30% of its peak velocity during the movement. Once this occurred, and the cursor was over an icon, the gain was adjusted downward to make the icon sticky.\n\nTo test our predictions, we compared six types of cursors:\n\n1.
