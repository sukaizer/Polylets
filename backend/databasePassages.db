As the W term gets smaller, the index of difficulty of the task increases. The extreme case of this is when the target is a point. In this paper, we show that selection in such cases can be facilitated if the cursor is an area, rather than a point. Furthermore, we show that when the target is a point and the width of the cursor is W, that Fitts' law still holds. An experiment is presented and the implications of the technique are discussed for both 2D and 3D interfaces.\n\nKEYWORDS:","annotation":"","fileId":0,"startIndex":7,"endIndex":8,"startOffset":210,"endOffset":9,"yPosition":0,"_id":"kup7egLI1Y118bUT"}

This paper describes a study of the effectiveness of two interaction techniques: area cursors and sticky icons, in improving the performance of older adults in basic selection tasks. The study described here indicates that when combined, these techniques can decrease target selection times for older adults by as much as 50°/0 when applied to the most difficult cases (smallest selection targets). At the same time these techniques are shown not to impede performance in cases known to be problematical for related techniques (e.g., differentiation between closely spaced targets) and to provide similar but smaller benefits for younger users.\n\n","annotation":"","fileId":1,"startIndex":7,"endIndex":8,"startOffset":212,"endOffset":0,"yPosition":0,"_id":"myu7QYxAL5gpeEkn"}
