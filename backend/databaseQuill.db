The initial drag direction is determined the moment the user drags an icon further than a given threshold (default 15 pixels). During preliminary testing on a Smartboard, we got good results with first-time users when using sector sizes of  30 to  45 degrees. The sector size could be reduced to sector sizes of  20 degrees as users gained more experience.

At t1, when the cursor reaches the proximal boundary of the first object, this object gets highlighted (gray shading in the figure), signaling that if a click or an ENTER key press were to happen now, the system would activate that particular object. However, this is information from the system— not to the system. What is occurring at t1 was trivially predictable from t0 because [AB] had to be reached anyway, regardless of whether or not it was the movement’s target. The message emitted by the user over the [t0, t1] interval is essentially redundant. In fact, the single bit of information the system has been waiting for since t0 is delivered at time t2, when the cursor crosses the upper boundary of target [AB]: at that moment, the cursor is moving rather fast (i.e., the slope of the trajectory is steep), so there is no doubt that the cursor is leaving the object—the probability that the cursor aims at target [CD] switches to 1. Had its velocity been low and its acceleration negative (braking) at t2, one would have been</a>  [] mapped computer displays, however, allow greater freedom in the placement, font, and general presentation of menus. A pie menu is a format where the items are placed along the circumference of a circle at equal radial distances from the center. Pie menus gain over traditional linear menus by reducing target seek time, lowering error rates by fixing the distance factor and increasing the target size in Fitts’s Law, minimizing the drift distance after target selection, and are, in general, subjectively equivalent to the </p>","_id":"9Fy75iDjQBztYf0d"}
