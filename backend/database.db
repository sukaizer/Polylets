As regards the secondary flow, it is propelled directly rearwardly by the fan to generate further thrust.</p>\n<p>The expansion in the turbines 8, which enables the compressor 4, 6 and the fan 6 to be driven, occurs at a high temperature because it occurs immediately after combustion. This turbine 8 is thus designed and dimensioned to operate under harsh temperature, pressure and fluid flow rate conditions.</p>\n<p>Each turbine includes a succession of stages each including a series of vanes evenly spaced about the driving shaft, the vanes which are subjected to the harshest conditions being those of the first expansion stages, called high pressure stages.</p>\n<p>Increased performance requirements result in designing engines operating in increasingly harsh environments, which implies increasing the temperature resistance of the high pressure vanes, and hence to reconsider the cooling thereof.</p>\n<p>Such a vane which appears in Fig.&nbsp;2 by being marked by 11 includes a root&nbsp;P partially represented and carrying a blade&nbsp;12 extending along a span direction&nbsp;EV substantially radial with respect to its axis of rotation&nbsp;AX. The blade&nbsp;12 extends from the root&nbsp;P up to the corresponding apex&nbsp;S at its free end, and it includes a pressure-side wall&nbsp;13 as well as a suction-side wall&nbsp;14. By skeleton, it is generally intended a median theoretical surface between the pressure-side wall and the suction-side wall, the skeleton being marked as SQ in the example of Fig.&nbsp;2.</p>\n<p>The pressure side&nbsp;13 and the suction side&nbsp;14 join on the one hand at the leading edge&nbsp;16 of the blade which corresponds to its upstream region&nbsp;AM, and on the other hand at its tapered trailing edge&nbsp;17 which corresponds to its downstream region&nbsp;AV. Upstream and downstream are understood with respect to the flow direction of the fluid surrounding the operating blade.</p>\n<p>In the region of the apex&nbsp;S, the blade&nbsp;11 comprises a closing wall&nbsp;18, with an orientation substantially normal to the span direction&nbsp;EV, and which extends from the pressure side to the suction side. The pressure-side wall&nbsp;13 terminates with an edge&nbsp;19 which projects from the closing wall&nbsp;18, and likewise, the suction-side wall&nbsp;14 terminates with an edge&nbsp;21 which also projects from the closing wall&nbsp;18, so as to delimit together with this closing wall&nbsp;18 a tub shape.</p>\n<p>When the blade is operating, that is when the engine is operating, the radial functional mechanical play separating the pressure-side and suction side terminal edges, of the engine case induces a leading vortex to the suction-side because of the pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side. This phenomenon gives rise to a leak flow rate inducing aerodynamical losses, as well as a warming of the vane apex.</p>\n<p>This functional mechanical play ensures that the vane end does not contact the case surrounding it, and its actual value depends on the operating regime of the engine which conditions the thermal expansions of the blade and the case.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the invention is to provide a vane structure enabling this drawback to be overcome.</p>\n<h1 id=\"disclosure-of-the-invention\">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</h1>\n<p>The invention relates to a turbine vane of a turbomachine such as a turbofan engine, this vane comprising a root carrying a blade which extends along a span direction terminating with an apex, this blade comprising a pressure-side wall and a suction-side wall each terminating with a terminal edge&nbsp;(27a, 27b, 27c, 28a, 28b, 28c) at the apex of the blade, the blade including at its apex a closing wall extending from the pressure side to the suction side, the terminal edge of the pressure side and the terminal edge of the suction side projecting from this wall for this wall to delimit with these terminal edges a tub shape, <span class=\"underline\">characterised</span> in that: the pressure-side wall is curved so as to deviate from the span direction in the region of the blade apex, this region being on the one hand located between the blade root and the tub and on the other hand contiguous to the tub.</p>\n<p>With this curvature arrangement of the blade upper segment which is distant from the root and contiguous to the tub, the pressure distribution at the blade apex is modified so as to limit the air flow rate bypassing the blade apex.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a vane thus defined, wherein the suction-side wall is curved so as to get closer to the span direction in the region of the blade apex preceding the tub.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a vane thus defined, wherein the terminal edge of the pressure-side wall is oriented in parallel to the span direction.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a vane thus defined, wherein the terminal edge of the pressure side is also curved to deviate from the span direction.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a vane thus defined, wherein the terminal edge of the suction-side wall is curved so as to get closer to the span direction.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a vane thus defined, wherein the terminal edge of the suction-side wall is oriented in parallel to the span direction.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a vane thus defined, wherein the terminal edge of the suction-side wall is curved so as to deviate from the span direction.</p>\n<h1 id=\"brief-description-of-the-drawings\">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</h1>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;1 is a longitudinal cross-section view of a known turbofan engine;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;2 is a perspective view of a known high pressure turbine vane;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;3 is a schematic representation of the fluid flow between the case and the apex of a known vane blade in a sectional plane perpendicular to the blade skeleton;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;4 is a schematic representation of the fluid flow between the case and the apex of a vane blade according to the invention in a sectional plane perpendicular to the blade skeleton;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;5 is a schematic representation of a first embodiment of a vane blade according to the invention viewed along a sectional plane perpendicular to its skeleton;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;6 is a representation of several curvature shapes of the pressure side in the region of the blade apex;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;7 is a representation of the offset of the pressure side and the suction side in the region of the blade apex;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;8 is a schematic representation of a second embodiment of the vane blade according to the invention viewed along a sectional plane perpendicular to its skeleton;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;9 is a schematic representation of a third embodiment of the vane blade according to the invention viewed along a sectional plane perpendicular to its skeleton.</p>\n<h1 id=\"detailed-disclosure-of-particular-embodiments\">DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</h1>\n<p>The blade&nbsp;22a according to the invention which is schematically represented in Fig.&nbsp;3 includes a pressure-side wall&nbsp;23a and a suction-side wall&nbsp;24a joined at its apex&nbsp;S by a closing wall&nbsp;26a with an orientation substantially perpendicular to its span direction&nbsp;EV.</p>\n<p>The pressure-side wall terminates at the apex&nbsp;S with a terminal edge&nbsp;27a, and the suction-side wall 24a terminates at the apex&nbsp;S with another terminal edge&nbsp;28a. These edges&nbsp;27a and 28a project from the closing wall&nbsp;26a to delimit together with this wall a tub&nbsp;29a, at the end of the blade apex&nbsp;S.</p>\n<p>As is visible in Fig.&nbsp;3, both edges&nbsp;27a and 28a are spaced apart from the engine case&nbsp;31 by a distance or functional mechanical play which is noted Jm. This mechanical play&nbsp;Jm ensures that the blade end does not rub against the case when the engine is operating.</p>\n<p>According to the invention, the pressure-side wall&nbsp;23a is curved in the apex region preceding the tub&nbsp;29 so as to deviate from the span axis&nbsp;EV of the blade, instead of remaining at a constant distance from this axis.</p>\n<p>This curvature enables the fluid flow to be modified between the blade apex&nbsp;S and the case&nbsp;31, by getting the current lines closer to the case, that is by deviating them from the closing wall. Under these conditions, the visible play&nbsp;Jv, that is the actual section which is free to let gas pass between the apex&nbsp;S and the case&nbsp;29 is significantly lower than the mechanical play&nbsp;Jm.</p>\n<p>More concretely, the curvature of the pressure-side wall&nbsp;13 at the blade end enables a high pressure fluid flow boundary layer to be created, which is marked as&nbsp;32, which extends substantially half-way between the edges&nbsp;27a, 28a and the inner face of the case&nbsp;29. The fluid can only circulate in the reduced space located between this boundary layer&nbsp;32 and the inner face of the case&nbsp;29. Between this boundary layer&nbsp;32 and the closing wall&nbsp;26a, the fluid does not circulate, or very little by forming mainly localised vortices.</p>\n<p>Under these conditions, the flow rate of gas which circulates between the end of the blade according to the invention and the case is reduced, because its actual passage section&nbsp;Jv, corresponding to the visible play for the fluid, is low by virtue of the pressure-side curvature which deviates the boundary layer&nbsp;32 to the inner wall of the case.</p>\n<p>In other words, the pressure-side curvature in the region of the blade apex makes bypassing this apex by the fluid more difficult, because this curvature tends to deviate the boundary layer&nbsp;32 from the blade apex.</p>\n<p>By way of comparison, Fig.&nbsp;4 enables the position of the boundary layer and the visible play to be viewed in the case of a known blade of the type of Fig.&nbsp;2, that is wherein the pressure side is straight instead of being curved. As is visible in Fig.&nbsp;4, the pressure side parallel to the span direction gives rise to a boundary layer which, unlike the case of the invention, is very close to the closing wall. This boundary layer thus reduces very little the space allowing gas circulation between the blade apex and the inner face of the case, thus inducing a significant leak flow rate.</p>\n<p>According to the invention, different geometrical configurations are possible for the blade, as illustrated in the different figures. Thus, in the example of Fig.&nbsp;3, the pressure-side wall is curved from a region preceding the tub&nbsp;29 with its closing wall&nbsp;29 along the span axis, up to the terminal edge&nbsp;27a of this pressure-side wall which extends in the continuity of the rest of the pressure-side wall. The curvature is oriented such that the pressure-side wall deviates from the span axis as the end of the blade apex&nbsp;S gets closer.</p>\n<p>In this example of Fig.&nbsp;3, the suction-side wall&nbsp;24a is also curved, to be substantially equidistant from the pressure-side wall: the suction-side wall&nbsp;24a gets closer to the span axis as the end of the blade apex&nbsp;S gets closer. The suction side&nbsp;24a is also curved from a portion preceding the tub along the span axis&nbsp;EV, to the terminal edge&nbsp;28a which extends from the bent portion of the suction-side wall&nbsp;24a.</p>\n<p>The shape of the curvature can advantageously be determined by the relationship below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"media/image1.png\">.</p>\n<p>In this relationship, Rmax designates the maximum blade radius, that is the distance separating the end of the blade apex from its axis of rotation&nbsp;AX, Rmin designates the blade radius where the pressure-side curvature starts, Rb designates the blade radius at its closing wall&nbsp;26a. Δmax designates the desired maximum offset at the end of the blade apex, and n designates the power associated with the offset smoothing.</p>\n<p>With this relationship, and as is illustrated in the graph of Fig.&nbsp;7, the curvature shape of the wall is conditioned by the n value, with the proviso that for n&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, a curved portion which is actually rectilinear or set is obtained, as in Fig.&nbsp;5. This curved portion takes an increasingly curved shape when n increases, with the proviso that at the very end, when n tends to infinity, the curved portion becomes a planar portion perpendicular to the span axis.</p>\n<p>This relationship defining the offset of the sections at the apex with respect to the skeleton of the trailing edge of the movable blade, enables losses due to the play vortex to be reduced.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, for a given section corresponding to a radius&nbsp;R, the offset&nbsp;Δ(R) of the profile of the wall is made in perpendicular to the skeleton direction&nbsp;SQ of the blade at its trailing edge, as schematically illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;6.</p>\n<p>As will be understood, the vane shape according to the invention is defined from a vane having a pressure side and a suction side extending in parallel to the span axis. The sections of this vane are then offset by the offset value Δ(R), along a direction perpendicular to the orientation of the skeleton in the region of the trailing edge.</p>\n<p>In the embodiment corresponding to Figs.&nbsp;3 and 5, the pressure-side wall&nbsp;23a and the suction-side wall&nbsp;24a are both curved from a portion preceding the tub&nbsp;29 or the closing wall&nbsp;26a, up to their end edges&nbsp;27a, 28a. The edges are thus oriented to extend from the pressure-side wall and the suction-side wall respectively.</p>\n<p>Generally, the curved portion of the pressure-side and suction-side walls extends over a blade height that can be between five and thirty percent of the total blade height, the curvature being located in the region of the blade apex. The rest of the pressure-side or suction-side wall is on the contrary straight, that is parallel to the axis&nbsp;EV.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to give to the terminal edges of the pressure side and suction side different inclinations or curvatures from those of the pressure-side wall and the succion-side wall in the region preceding the tub.</p>\n<p>This is the case in the second embodiment of the invention illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;8, wherein the blade&nbsp;22b includes a pressure-side wall which is curved to deviate from the span axis in the region preceding the tub delimited by the closing wall&nbsp;26b along the axis&nbsp;EV. But in this second embodiment, the terminal edge&nbsp;27b of the pressure-side wall&nbsp;23b is straight, that is it extends in parallel to the span direction&nbsp;EV.</p>\n<p>In the same way, in this second embodiment, the suction-side wall&nbsp;24b is also curved on a portion preceding the closing wall&nbsp;26b by getting closer to the axis&nbsp;EV, but the edge&nbsp;28b of this suction-side wall&nbsp;24b is in turn straight, that is parallel to the axis&nbsp;EV.</p>\n<p>It is still possible, alternatively, to provide that the edge&nbsp;28b of the suction side&nbsp;24b with a curvature reverse from the curvature of the suction-side wall in the region preceding the tub. In this case, the suction-side wall&nbsp;24b gets closer to the axis&nbsp;EV in the region preceding the tub, and it deviates from this axis&nbsp;EV at its terminal edge. This arrangement enables among other things the tub to be widened in order to have greater efficiency.</p>\n<p>In the third embodiment illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;9, and which also aims at widening the tub, the blade&nbsp;22c comprises a pressure-side wall&nbsp;23c of the same type as that of the first embodiment corresponding to Figs.&nbsp;3 and 5, that is curved to deviate from the axis&nbsp;EV, from a portion preceding the tub&nbsp;29 up to its edge&nbsp;27c which is curved in the same direction.</p>\n<p>But in this third embodiment, the suction-side edge&nbsp;24c is in turn straight including in the entire portion preceding the tub, and its terminal edge&nbsp;28c, which contributes to delimiting the tub, is also curved to deviate from the axis&nbsp;EV, which gives to the tub a flared shape widening towards the blade end.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, it is also possible to provide that the suction-side wall&nbsp;24c is curved to deviate from the span axis&nbsp;EV in the portion preceding the tub by being extended by its terminal edge which also deviates from the span axis. This alternative gives to the blade apex a flared shape providing the tub with a width higher than that of the second embodiment.</p>\n<p>As is understood, the invention enables the direction of the pressure-side edge to be differently adapted from that of the suction-side edge with respect to the reference direction which is the shape of the corresponding wall under the tub region.</p>\n<p>Generally, the invention enables leaks to be reduced at the blade apex without having to add material, thus mass, to the blade, which increases the turbine efficiency. The robustness of the turbine performance during the engine life is increased too.</p>\n<p>The design flexibility brought about by the invention is summarised as a local modification which can be applied when the blades of an existing engine have to be removed.</p>\n<p>The invention not only allows aerodynamic compensation but further does not oppose to curvature retrofits of the vane walls relating to a mechanical compensation offset. Advantageously, the aerodynamical compensation according to the invention is compatible with offsets of mechanical compensations, these offsets being for minimising stresses in the vane upon rotating.</p>\n<p>=</p>\n<h1 id=\"claims\">CLAIMS</h1>\n<p>1.&nbsp;A turbine vane of a turbomachine such as a turbofan engine, this vane comprising a root carrying a blade&nbsp;(22a, 22b, 22c) which extends along a span direction&nbsp;(EV) terminating with an apex&nbsp;(S), this blade&nbsp;(22a, 22b, 22c) comprising a pressure-side wall&nbsp;(23a, 23b, 23c) and a suction-side wall&nbsp;(24a, 24b, 24c) each terminating with a terminal edge&nbsp;(27a, 27b, 27c, 28a, 28b, 28c) at the apex&nbsp;(S) of the blade&nbsp;(22a, 22b, 22c), the blade&nbsp;(22a, 22b, 22c) including at its apex&nbsp;(S) a closing wall&nbsp;(26a, 26b, 26c) extending from the pressure side&nbsp;(23a, 23b, 23c) to the suction side&nbsp;(24a, 24b, 24c), the terminal edge&nbsp;(27a, 27b, 27c) of the pressure side and the terminal edge of the suction side&nbsp;(28a, 28b, 28c) projecting from this wall for this wall to delimit with these terminal edges a tub shape&nbsp;(29), <span class=\"underline\">characterised</span> in that: the pressure-side wall&nbsp;(23a, 23b, 23c) is curved so as to deviate from the span direction&nbsp;(EV) in the region of the blade apex&nbsp;(S), from a region located between the blade root and the tub&nbsp;(29), the shape of the curvature of the pressure-side wall&nbsp;(23a, 23b, 23c) being determined by the relationship:</p>\n<p><img src=\"media/image1.png\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>in which:</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Δ(R) designates an offset value of the pressure-side wall, for a section located at a radius&nbsp;R from the axis of rotation&nbsp;(AX) of the blade;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Rmax designates a maximum radius of the blade from the end of the blade apex&nbsp;(S) to the axis of rotation&nbsp;(AX);</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Rmin designates the radius of the blade where the curvature of the pressure-side wall starts;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Δmax designates the maximum offset at the end of the blade apex;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;n designates a smoothing power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>2.&nbsp;The vane according to claim&nbsp;1, wherein the terminal edge&nbsp;(28a) of the suction-side wall&nbsp;(24a) is curved so as to get closer to the span direction&nbsp;(EV).</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;The vane according to claim&nbsp;1, wherein the terminal edge&nbsp;(27b) of the pressure-side wall&nbsp;(23b) is oriented in parallel to the span direction&nbsp;(EV).</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp;The vane according to claim&nbsp;1, wherein the suction-side wall&nbsp;(24a, 24b, 24c) is curved so as to get closer to the span direction in the region of the blade apex&nbsp;(S) preceding the tub&nbsp;(29).</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;The vane according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the terminal edge&nbsp;(27a, 27c) of the pressure side&nbsp;(23a, 23c) is also curved to deviate from the span direction&nbsp;(EV).</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp;The vane according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the terminal edge&nbsp;(28b) of the suction-side wall&nbsp;(24b) is oriented in parallel to the span direction&nbsp;(EV).</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp;The vane according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the terminal edge&nbsp;(28c) of the suction-side wall&nbsp;(24c) is curved so as to deviate from the span direction&nbsp;(EV).</p>\n<p>8.&nbsp;A turbine of a turbomachine comprising a vane according to any of claims&nbsp;1 to 7.</p>\n<p>9.&nbsp;A turbomachine comprising a turbine according to the preceding claim.</p>\n<p>=</p>\n<h1 id=\"abstract\">ABSTRACT</h1>\n<p>The invention relates to a turbine vane of a turbine engine such as a turbojet.

The mechanism thus compensates for any asymmetric wear of the pads by ensuring that the two pads with different thicknesses both rest on the disc when the rotary shaft is moved.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a caliper thus defined, wherein the first and the second primary toothed wheel rotate about axes parallel to each other and perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the rotary shaft.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a caliper thus defined, wherein each actuator includes a driving toothed wheel connected to the corresponding piston by a helical connection, and a gear train through which the driving toothed wheel is movably connected to one of the worm gears of the rotary shaft.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a caliper thus defined, wherein the gear train of each actuator includes the primary toothed wheel of this actuator as well as a secondary toothed wheel meshed in the primary toothed wheel and in oblique circumferential teeth of the driving toothed wheel.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a brake for an automobile vehicle, comprising a caliper thus defined, as well as a braking disc.</p>\n<h1 id=\"brief-description-of-the-drawings\">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</h1>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;1 is a transverse cross-section view of a brake according to the invention showing a disc portion and the caliper when the outer pad is more strongly worn than the inner pad;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;2 is a front view of the mechanism according to the invention showing its transmission and its actuators when the brake is completely released;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;3 is a rear view of the mechanism according to the invention showing its transmission and its actuators when the brake is applied.</p>\n<h1 id=\"detailed-disclosure-of-particular-embodiments\">DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</h1>\n<p>The brake according to the invention which is marked as 1 in Fig.&nbsp;1 includes a disc&nbsp;2 overlapped by a caliper&nbsp;3 which includes a first lateral portion&nbsp;4 by which it is carried by a chassis element not represented, and a second side portion&nbsp;6, located opposite to the first portion&nbsp;4. The caliper overlaps the disc&nbsp;2 such that this disc is sandwiched between its side portions&nbsp;4 and 6.</p>\n<p>The first portion&nbsp;4 carries a first friction pad&nbsp;7 as well as a first mechanical actuator&nbsp;8 to press this pad against a face of the disc&nbsp;2. Analogously, the second portion&nbsp;6 carries a second friction pad&nbsp;9, and a second mechanical actuator&nbsp;11 to press this second pad against the disc, when the brake is controlled.</p>\n<p>The first actuator&nbsp;8 includes a driving member in the form of a toothed wheel&nbsp;12 comprising a hub forming a nut in which a screw&nbsp;29 is disposed, the end of which directed to the disc&nbsp;2 carries a head, for example a conical head&nbsp;30, resting on the bottom of the piston&nbsp;13. The piston&nbsp;13 is translationally movable along the axis&nbsp;AX, in a chamber or jacket of the first portion&nbsp;4 of the caliper, by being rotatably blocked about this axis&nbsp;AX, for example by a radial stud.</p>\n<p>When the wheel&nbsp;12 is rotatably driven about the axis&nbsp;AX, it causes the piston&nbsp;13 to be thereby moved along this axis, in either direction along the axis&nbsp;AX, along the direction of rotation of this wheel&nbsp;12 about the axis&nbsp;AX.</p>\n<p>In the same way, the second actuator&nbsp;6 includes a driving toothed wheel&nbsp;14 and a piston&nbsp;16 along the axis&nbsp;AX, to move the piston&nbsp;16 along the axis&nbsp;AX when the wheel&nbsp;14 is rotated.</p>\n<p>When the brake is new, both pads&nbsp;7 and 9 have the same thickness, but these thicknesses become different, in view of the wear of these pads over time, which can be asymmetric. Thus, in the example of Fig.&nbsp;1, the second pad, that is the pad&nbsp;9 has a thickness much lower than the first pad, that is the pad&nbsp;7.</p>\n<p>Generally, the asymmetry in wear is not foreseeable, such that it is on the contrary the second pad&nbsp;9 which has a thickness much higher than the first pad&nbsp;7.</p>\n<p>The mechanical actuators&nbsp;8 and 11 have their driving wheels&nbsp;12, 14 which are rotatably driven by a same motor marked as M, through a transmission assembly marked as 17 in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3.</p>\n<p>The transmission assembly&nbsp;17 includes on the one hand a driving shaft or axis&nbsp;18, with an orientation parallel to the axis&nbsp;AX, and which is coupled to the motor&nbsp;M advantageously by a gear reducer not represented to be rotated by the same, while preserving a translation degree of freedom along the axis&nbsp;AX with respect to the motor and the frame of the brake caliper.</p>\n<p>This shaft&nbsp;18 carries a first worm gear&nbsp;19 located at the first actuator&nbsp;8 to rotatably drive the first driving wheel&nbsp;12, and a second worm gear&nbsp;21 located at the second actuator&nbsp;11 to rotatably drive the second wheel&nbsp;14, both these worm gears&nbsp;19, 21 being rigidly integral with the shaft&nbsp;18 carrying them.</p>\n<p>The first worm gear&nbsp;19 is engaged in a primary toothed wheel&nbsp;22 of a first gear train&nbsp;23 of the first actuator&nbsp;8, this primary wheel&nbsp;22 being itself meshed with a secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;24 of this first gear train&nbsp;23. This secondary wheel&nbsp;24 is besides meshed with oblique teeth of the periphery of the first toothed wheel&nbsp;12 of the first actuator&nbsp;8.</p>\n<p>In practice, when the shaft&nbsp;18 rotates by being driven by the motor&nbsp;M, its first worm gear&nbsp;19 rotatably drives the toothed wheel&nbsp;12 through the first gear train&nbsp;23 which makes up a gear reducer.</p>\n<p>Analogously, the second worm gear&nbsp;21 is engaged in another primary toothed wheel&nbsp;26 of a second gear train&nbsp;27 of the second actuator&nbsp;11, which is itself meshed with another secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;28 engaged in peripheral oblique teeth of the second toothed wheel&nbsp;14.</p>\n<p>Thus, when the shaft&nbsp;18 rotates, its second worm gear&nbsp;21 drives the second driving wheel&nbsp;14 via the second gear train&nbsp;27 which makes up another gear reducer.</p>\n<p>As is visible in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3, the axes of rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 and of the driving wheels&nbsp;12 and 14 are parallel to the axis&nbsp;AX, whereas on the contrary, the axes of rotation of all the toothed wheels of the first and second gear trains are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axis&nbsp;AX.</p>\n<p>Besides, the threads of the first and of the second worm gears are in reverse directions: the first worm gear&nbsp;19 is backside threaded, whereas the second screw&nbsp;21 is face threaded, such that a rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 in a first direction of rotation causes whereas a rotation in a second direction of rotation causes them other to be diverted.</p>\n<p>When the shaft&nbsp;18 is rotatably driven in the reverse direction marked as IND in Figs.&nbsp;2 and 3, the first worm gear&nbsp;19 drives the primary wheel&nbsp;22 in the forward direction which itself drives the secondary wheel&nbsp;24 in the reverse direction. The secondary wheel&nbsp;24 thereby drives the second driving wheel&nbsp;12 in the forward direction, which causes the piston&nbsp;13 to come out.</p>\n<p>As the second worm gear&nbsp;21 has a thread in the reverse direction as that of the first gear&nbsp;19, this same rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 in the reverse direction analogously causes a rotation of the second driving wheel&nbsp;14 but in the reverse direction, this also causes the second piston to come out, because in particular these pistons are facing each other.</p>\n<p>When the brake is controlled to press the pads on the disc, the pad carried by either of these pistons comes to rest on the braking disc before the other one, which makes the piston carrying it stationary, as well as the primary wheel of the gear train of this piston.</p>\n<p>The shaft&nbsp;18 continues to rotate, but the worm gear driving the piston carrying the pad which is already resting on the disc is meshed in the corresponding primary wheel which is blocked in position. Since this primary wheel is blocked, the rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 causes the simultaneous translation of this shaft along the direction of its length. Under these conditions, the piston carrying the pad which is not still in contact with the disc continues to come out under the effect of the rotation of the shaft&nbsp;18 and of the worm gear associated with this piston.</p>\n<p>Once the other pad comes to rest on the disc, the piston carrying it becomes stationary, and likewise, the primary wheel corresponding to the gear train driving this piston is blocked, such that the shaft&nbsp;18 also becomes stationary because it is rotatably blocked by both primary wheels&nbsp;22 and 26.</p>\n<p>As is understood, the brake according to the invention naturally enables an asymmetric wear of both pads to be compensated for since it ensures that a first pad comes to rest to the disc, the other pad continues to be moved until it comes in turn to rest on the disc with the desired force. In the description above, the operation of the brake according to the invention has been explained in terms of movement of its components in order to facilitate comprehension thereof, with the proviso that in practice, the movements have reliable amplitudes and these are mainly forces which are transmitted by the different components.</p>\n<p>In the description above, the rotary shaft drives two simple actuators located on either side of the disc, but an analogous system in which the rotary shaft drives two multiple actuators located on either side of the disc, and each including several movable pistons moved by as many driving wheels does not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p>\n<p>Besides, in the example of the figures, each worm gear drives the driving wheel of the corresponding actuator through a primary wheel and a secondary wheel rotating about axes perpendicular to the axis of the shaft. Of course, a primary wheel with oblique teeth, meshed in the worm gear and in the driving wheel, this primary wheel with oblique teeth thereby rotating about an axis oriented 45° with respect to the rotary shaft does not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p>\n<p>Nomenclature:</p>\n<p>1: brake</p>\n<p>2: disc</p>\n<p>3: caliper</p>\n<p>4: first portion</p>\n<p>6: second portion</p>\n<p>7: first pad</p>\n<p>8: first actuator</p>\n<p>9: second pad</p>\n<p>11: second actuator</p>\n<p>12: first driving wheel</p>\n<p>13: first piston</p>\n<p>14: second driving wheel</p>\n<p>16: second piston</p>\n<p>17: transmission assembly</p>\n<p>18: driving shaft or axis</p>\n<p>19: first worm gear</p>\n<p>21: second worm gear</p>\n<p>22: primary toothed wheel</p>\n<p>23: first gear train</p>\n<p>24: secondary toothed wheel</p>\n<p>26: other primary toothed wheel</p>\n<p>27: second gear train</p>\n<p>28: other secondary toothed wheel</p>\n<p>AX: axis</p>\n<p>IND: reverse direction</p>\n<p>M: motor</p>\n<h1 id=\"claims\">CLAIMS</h1>\n<p>1.&nbsp;A brake caliper&nbsp;(3) of an automobile vehicle, for overlapping an outer edge of a braking disc&nbsp;(2), this caliper comprising a first pad&nbsp;(7) and a second pad&nbsp;(9) for being on either side of the disc&nbsp;(2) to be pressed against this disc&nbsp;(2), as well as:</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;a first mechanical actuator&nbsp;(8) including a first movable piston&nbsp;(13) and a first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22), the first piston&nbsp;(13) resting on the first pad&nbsp;(7) to press it against the disc by rotating the first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22);</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;a second mechanical actuator&nbsp;(11) including a second movable piston&nbsp;(16) and a second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26), the second piston&nbsp;(16) resting on the second pad&nbsp;(9) to press it against the disc by rotating the second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26);</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;a rotary shaft&nbsp;(18) including a first worm gear&nbsp;(19) and a second worm gear&nbsp;(21) having a winding direction opposite to that of the first worm gear&nbsp;(19), the driving shaft&nbsp;(18) being translationally movable along its own longitudinal direction;</p>\n<p>–&nbsp;an electric motor&nbsp;(M) for driving the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18);</p>\n<p>and wherein the first worm gear&nbsp;(19) is meshed in the first primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22), and the second worm gear&nbsp;(21) is meshed in the second primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(26).</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;1, wherein the first and the second primary toothed wheel rotate about axes parallel to each other and perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18).</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;1 or 2, wherein each actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) includes a driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14) connected to the corresponding piston&nbsp;(13, 16) by a helical connection, and a gear train&nbsp;(23, 27) through which the driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14) is movably connected to one of the worm gears of the rotary shaft&nbsp;(18).</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp;The caliper according to claim&nbsp;3, wherein the gear train&nbsp;(23, 27) of each actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) includes the primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22, 26) of this actuator&nbsp;(8, 11) as well as a secondary toothed wheel&nbsp;(24, 28) meshed in the primary toothed wheel&nbsp;(22, 26) and in oblique circumferential teeth of the driving toothed wheel&nbsp;(12, 14).</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;A brake for an automobile vehicle, comprising a caliper according to one of the preceding claims, as well as a braking disc&nbsp;(2).</p>\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>\n<p>The invention relates to a brake comprising:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;a caliper overlapping a disk;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;a first pad and a second pad (7, 9) which are carried by the caliper (3) on either side of the disk (2);</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;a first actuator (8) including a first primary toothed wheel (22) driving a first mobile piston (13) pressing against the first pad (7) in order to move same;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;a second actuator (11) including a second primary toothed wheel (26) driving a second mobile piston (16) pressing against the second pad (9);</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;a rotating shaft (18) comprising a first and a second endless screw (19, 21) having opposite winding directions, the shaft (18) being movable in translation; and</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;an electric motor (M) for driving the rotating shaft (18);</p>\n<p>and in which the first and second endless screws (19, 21) are engaged in the first and second primary toothed wheels (22, 26) respectively.</p>\n<p>FIG. 2.</p>\n\n\n","_id":"9yVJk7KenFUdRQPv"}

The panels are fixed to the support structure by C-clamps marked 4.</p>\n<p>The panels shown in more detail in the sectional view in figure 2 are attached by cooperation of the C-clamps 4 with the particular so-called Omega section of the sections 6 forming the support structure.</p>\n<p>Each section 6 has a transverse cross-section in the shape of the letter Omega: this cross-section is composed of a main concave portion 7 open facing the outside of the chamber and that is terminated by two flanges 8 and 9 at an increasing separation distance from each other.</p>\n<p>The main concave portion 7 extends over about three-quarters of a turn around the axis of the section 6. It is globally square in shape with four consecutive sides 11, 12, 13 and 14 but one of its vertices is missing at its opening in the direction opposite the chamber. The sides 12 and 13 are at the bottom of the cross-section while the sides 11 and 14 correspond to the sides that will be on the outside of the chamber, and in contact with which the chamber closing panels marked 16 and 17 are applied.</p>\n<p>The flange 8 extends along the side 11 extending perpendicular to this side 11 and in the direction opposite the central region of the chamber. Similarly, the flange 9 extends the side 14, and is perpendicular to this side in the direction opposite the central region of the chamber. There is thus a right angle between the two flanges 8 and 9, and they jointly delimit a tapered opening in the section facing outwards.</p>\n<p>As can be seen in figure 2, the inside face 18 of the panel 16 is applied onto the side 11 of the section 6, through a seal 19 inserted between this panel 16 and the side 11.</p>\n<p>The side 21 of this panel 16 is facing the flange 8 of the section 6, and the panel 16 is held pressed in contact with the side 11 by a C-clamp 4. The C-clamp 4 has a fixed key 23 that engages in the concave part of the section to bear on the inside face of the side 11, and a mobile key 24 that bears on the outside face 26 of the panel 16 through clamping packing 27 called the backing frame. This backing frame uniformly distributes the isolated clamping force of the different C-clamps, to limit stresses in the panel that can be fragile when it is made of polymethacrylate.</p>\n<p>The C-clamps 4 are thus distributed around the periphery of the panel 16 to hold it in sealed contact with the support structure also called the casing, that is formed jointly by the sections assembled to each other.</p>\n<p>In practice, the number of joint clamps is large to achieve a satisfactory seal, such that the assembly of such a glove box is necessarily long and tedious. Clamping of the first joint clamps while maintaining a backing frame tends to move the backing frame and even to make it drop. Furthermore, the operator determines the separation between the joint clamps such that it might be excessively random and vary from one operator to another. Retightening of one joint clamp tends to loosen the adjacent joint clamps and even make them move. Furthermore, the threads in the clamping screws of each joint clamp form portions that can be difficult to decontaminate if there is any contamination on the outside of the box. Finally, the series of joint clamps fitted on a globe box project such that they can get caught in clothes and/or overalls of operators.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this invention is to disclose a solution to overcome these disadvantages.</p>\n<p><strong>PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION</strong></p>\n<p>To achieve this, the purpose of the invention is a panel assembly strip by clamping the periphery of this panel on a section of a support structure to form a closed chamber, this strip comprising a body including a base prolonged by two sides that together delimit a straight groove that will overlap one edge of the panel and one edge of the section to clamp them together, one of the edges comprising several threaded holes, each threaded hole being provided with a clamping screw.</p>\n<p>This strip is thus elongated in shape facilitating its gripping, and it has several uniformly spaced clamping screws, which significantly simplifies assembly of a panel.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a strip thus defined, also comprising a bearing buffer of the same length as the body and running along the side that supports each clamping screw, at least one clamping screw being fixed to the pressure buffer while being free to rotate relative to this bearing buffer.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a strip thus defined comprising two clamping screws fixed to the bearing buffer, each free to rotate relative to this buffer, these two screws being the two screws closest to the ends of the body.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a strip thus defined, comprising a protective tab extending the side supporting the clamping screws to cover the space separating this side from the panel when the strip is in place.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a strip thus defined, in which the tab is an add-on element fixed by insertion and/or gluing on the outside face of the side on which the clamping screws are fitted.</p>\n<p>The invention also relates to a strip thus defined in which the add-on element comprising the tab is inserted into the threaded holes of the side that supports it.</p>\n<p><strong>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</strong></p>\n<p>Figure 1 is a perspective view of a glove box according to the state of the art;</p>\n<p>Figure 2 is a sectional view of a section of a glove box structure to which two panels are fixed by joint clamps according to the state of the art;</p>\n<p>Figure 3 is a perspective view of a clamping strip body according to the invention;</p>\n<p>Figure 4 is a cross-sectional view of a clamping strip according to the invention that clamps a section and a panel;</p>\n<p>Figure 5 is a cross-sectional view of a clamping strip according to the invention that clamps a section and a panel;</p>\n<p>Figure 6 is a partial view of a panel mounted on a structure using clamping strips according to the invention.</p>\n<p><strong>DETAILED PRESENTATION OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS </strong></p>\n<p>The basic idea of the invention is to replace the series of isolated joint clamps used in the state of the art by linear strips each comprising a linear body carrying several clamping screws and a backing frame element mounted in a captive manner.</p>\n<p>Figure 3 shows a section 28 with a chamber structure supporting a lateral panel 29 that is mounted on this structure by means of a strip according to the invention marked 31.</p>\n<p>The section 28 comprises one side 32 on which an inside face 33 of the panel 29 bears and that is prolonged by a flange 34 extending perpendicular to this side. The panel 29 is applied in contact with the bearing side 32 through a seal 36, being positioned such that the edge of this panel 29 is facing the flange 34 and is close to it.</p>\n<p>The strip 31 comprises a main body 37 visible in figure 4, similar to a section with a cross-section in the shape of the letter C and that will overlap the edge of a panel 29 and the corresponding side of a section so as to clamp them together.</p>\n<p>This main body 37, which may for example be made of aluminium, thus delimits an internal groove 38 that extends along the main direction of this body denoted AX. It comprises two edges 39 and 41 each corresponding to a branch of the C-section of this body and that are connected through a central base 42.</p>\n<p>In this case, the edge 41 of this main body comprises four through threaded holes 44 parallel to each other and perpendicular to the direction AX, and each opening up into the groove 38 at the inside face of the edge 41. Each threaded hole will hold a clamping screw like the screw 46 shown in figures 3 and 5, which is a so-called setscrew, the screwing end of which comprises a cavity. This cavity may for example be a hollow hex cavity into which a key or an appropriate tool can be inserted for tightening.</p>\n<p>As can be seen in figure 3, the edge 41 carrying the clamping screws is sufficiently thick so that these screws that are also designed to be relatively short, do not project beyond the outside face of the edge 41 when they are installed.</p>\n<p>The clamping end of each screw 46 projects into the groove 38 of the inside face of the edge 41 so that it is facing the opposite edge, namely the edge 39. As can be seen in figures 3 and 5, the strip according to the invention also comprises a backing frame element marked 47 that is fixed to the rest of the strip so that it is captive and thus simplifies box assembly operations.</p>\n<p>More particularly, two of the four screws 46 have clamping ends in the form of an end piece or stud, and each of these ends is engaged and clamped in a corresponding hole of the element of the backing frame. These two screws 46 that in this case are screws located at the end of the body 37 are thus fixed to the backing frame element so that it becomes captive, while these screws are free to rotate relative to this element. The other two screws 46, namely in this case the two central screws, can be installed normally.</p>\n<p>As can be seen in the figures, the backing frame element 47 forms a bearing buffer formed by a strip or plate with a rectangular contour, the length of which is equal to the length of the strip body, and the width of which is equal to the depth of the groove 38.</p>\n<p>With this assembly, the backing frame element 47 is captive relative to the remainder of the strip and it performs the function of uniformly distributing clamping forces of the different screws 46 when the assembly is in position.</p>\n<p>Note that the number of screws included in a strip may be adapted at the time of the design to the application for which the strip is designed, depending particularly on the intensity of the required average clamping force.</p>\n<p>At the same time, a protective skirt in the form of a flexible tab forming an apron marked 48 prolongs the edge 41 of the strip body 37 extending approximately parallel to the bottom of the groove 38. This apron may be made of metal or plastic.</p>\n<p>When the assembly is in position, as can be seen in figures 3 and 5, the free edge of the flexible tab 48 is bearing on the outside face of the panel, such that it covers the region of the strip located between the element of the backing frame the edge 41 of the strip body, comprising the threads of the screws 46, in an approximately sealed manner.</p>\n<p>This tab may be fixed to the body of the strip by being added onto the outside face of its edge or side 41, and possibly being fixed to the holes in which the clamping screws are located.</p>\n<p>Each strip may be pre-fitted with a protective tab with the same length as the strip body. But it would also be possible to add a single interstice-free tab onto a set of installed strips to improve protection against contamination.</p>\n<p>Each tab may be in the form of a protective cover that can be reversibly push fitted and removed without any tools on and from the side of the strip body and into and from the threaded holes of its screws.</p>\n<p>As can be seen in the figures, the strip according to the invention can be used to clamp a section side 32 fitted with a seal 36 and a panel 29 to fix them together, by compressing them between the frame element 47 squeezed by the tightened screws 46 and the edge or side 39 of the strip body.</p>\n<p>Due to this captive backing frame element, the assembly of the strip is significantly simplified because the operator can hold the strip body in position with one hand and tighten the screws of the strip in question with the other hand. Furthermore, the lack of relief and sharp edges on these strips facilitates their manipulation and cleaning.</p>\n<p>As shown in figure 6, the strips 31 are mounted adjacent to each other along the edge of the frame to tighten this frame around its periphery and to achieve appropriate leak tightness.</p>\n<p>In general, the invention is applicable to closed chambers composed of a structure supporting panels clamped onto this structure, such as chambers used in incubators in hospitals. Such chambers may also correspond to spaces dedicated to the isolation of chemicals and bacteriological agents in the medical or pharmaceutical field. It can also be used for mobile chambers to be assembled quickly in civilian or military operating theatres.</p>\n<p><strong>CLAIMS</strong></p>\n<p>1.
