{"id":3,"locId":3,"passage":" Use: Area Cursors and Sticky Icons\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe normal effects of aging include some decline in cognitive, perceptual, and motor abilities. This can have a negative effect on the performance of a number of tasks, including basic pointing and selection tasks common to today’s graphical user interfaces. This paper describes a study of the effectiveness of two interaction techniques: area cursors and sticky icons, in improving the performance of older adults in basic selection tasks. The study described here indicates that when combined, these techniques can decrease target selection times for older adults by as much as 50°/0 when applied to the most difficult cases (smallest selection targets). At the same time these techniques are shown not to impede performance in cases known to be problematical for related techniques (e.g., differentiation between closely spaced targets) and to provide similar but smaller benefits for younger users.","annotation":"dff","fileId":1,"startIndex":"5,0,0","endIndex":"7,0","startOffset":43,"endOffset":903,"yPosition":0,"_id":"PJkD7BJQs4SbILnT"}
