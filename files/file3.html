<p><strong>TURBINE VANE COMPRISING A BLADE WITH A TUB INCLUDING A CURVED PRESSURE SIDE IN A BLADE APEX REGION</strong></p>
<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<h1 id="technical-field">TECHNICAL FIELD</h1>
<p>The invention relates to a vane of a turbomachine type aircraft engine, such as for example a bypass turbojet engine or a bypass turboprop engine.</p>
<h1 id="state-of-prior-art">STATE OF PRIOR ART</h1>
<p>In such an engine 1, outside air is taken in an inlet duct 2 to pass through a fan 3 comprising a series of rotating blades before being splitted into a central primary flow and a secondary flow surrounding the primary flow.</p>
<p>The primary flow is then compressed by passing through a first and a second compression stage 4 and 6, before coming into a combustion chamber 7, after which it is expanded by passing through a set of turbines 8 before being discharged rearwardly by generating thrust. As regards the secondary flow, it is propelled directly rearwardly by the fan to generate further thrust.</p>
<p>The expansion in the turbines 8, which enables the compressor 4, 6 and the fan 6 to be driven, occurs at a high temperature because it occurs immediately after combustion. This turbine 8 is thus designed and dimensioned to operate under harsh temperature, pressure and fluid flow rate conditions.</p>
<p>Each turbine includes a succession of stages each including a series of vanes evenly spaced about the driving shaft, the vanes which are subjected to the harshest conditions being those of the first expansion stages, called high pressure stages.</p>
<p>Increased performance requirements result in designing engines operating in increasingly harsh environments, which implies increasing the temperature resistance of the high pressure vanes, and hence to reconsider the cooling thereof.</p>
<p>Such a vane which appears in Fig. 2 by being marked by 11 includes a root P partially represented and carrying a blade 12 extending along a span direction EV substantially radial with respect to its axis of rotation AX. The blade 12 extends from the root P up to the corresponding apex S at its free end, and it includes a pressure-side wall 13 as well as a suction-side wall 14. By skeleton, it is generally intended a median theoretical surface between the pressure-side wall and the suction-side wall, the skeleton being marked as SQ in the example of Fig. 2.</p>
<p>The pressure side 13 and the suction side 14 join on the one hand at the leading edge 16 of the blade which corresponds to its upstream region AM, and on the other hand at its tapered trailing edge 17 which corresponds to its downstream region AV. Upstream and downstream are understood with respect to the flow direction of the fluid surrounding the operating blade.</p>
<p>In the region of the apex S, the blade 11 comprises a closing wall 18, with an orientation substantially normal to the span direction EV, and which extends from the pressure side to the suction side. The pressure-side wall 13 terminates with an edge 19 which projects from the closing wall 18, and likewise, the suction-side wall 14 terminates with an edge 21 which also projects from the closing wall 18, so as to delimit together with this closing wall 18 a tub shape.</p>
<p>When the blade is operating, that is when the engine is operating, the radial functional mechanical play separating the pressure-side and suction side terminal edges, of the engine case induces a leading vortex to the suction-side because of the pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side. This phenomenon gives rise to a leak flow rate inducing aerodynamical losses, as well as a warming of the vane apex.</p>
<p>This functional mechanical play ensures that the vane end does not contact the case surrounding it, and its actual value depends on the operating regime of the engine which conditions the thermal expansions of the blade and the case.</p>
<p>The purpose of the invention is to provide a vane structure enabling this drawback to be overcome.</p>
<h1 id="disclosure-of-the-invention">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</h1>
<p>The invention relates to a turbine vane of a turbomachine such as a turbofan engine, this vane comprising a root carrying a blade which extends along a span direction terminating with an apex, this blade comprising a pressure-side wall and a suction-side wall each terminating with a terminal edge (27a, 27b, 27c, 28a, 28b, 28c) at the apex of the blade, the blade including at its apex a closing wall extending from the pressure side to the suction side, the terminal edge of the pressure side and the terminal edge of the suction side projecting from this wall for this wall to delimit with these terminal edges a tub shape, <span class="underline">characterised</span> in that: the pressure-side wall is curved so as to deviate from the span direction in the region of the blade apex, this region being on the one hand located between the blade root and the tub and on the other hand contiguous to the tub.</p>
<p>With this curvature arrangement of the blade upper segment which is distant from the root and contiguous to the tub, the pressure distribution at the blade apex is modified so as to limit the air flow rate bypassing the blade apex.</p>

<h1 id="detailed-disclosure-of-particular-embodiments">DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</h1>
<p>The blade 22a according to the invention which is schematically represented in Fig. 3 includes a pressure-side wall 23a and a suction-side wall 24a joined at its apex S by a closing wall 26a with an orientation substantially perpendicular to its span direction EV.</p>
<p>The pressure-side wall terminates at the apex S with a terminal edge 27a, and the suction-side wall 24a terminates at the apex S with another terminal edge 28a. These edges 27a and 28a project from the closing wall 26a to delimit together with this wall a tub 29a, at the end of the blade apex S.</p>
<p>As is visible in Fig. 3, both edges 27a and 28a are spaced apart from the engine case 31 by a distance or functional mechanical play which is noted Jm. This mechanical play Jm ensures that the blade end does not rub against the case when the engine is operating.</p>
<p>According to the invention, the pressure-side wall 23a is curved in the apex region preceding the tub 29 so as to deviate from the span axis EV of the blade, instead of remaining at a constant distance from this axis.</p>
<p>This curvature enables the fluid flow to be modified between the blade apex S and the case 31, by getting the current lines closer to the case, that is by deviating them from the closing wall. Under these conditions, the visible play Jv, that is the actual section which is free to let gas pass between the apex S and the case 29 is significantly lower than the mechanical play Jm.</p>
<p>More concretely, the curvature of the pressure-side wall 13 at the blade end enables a high pressure fluid flow boundary layer to be created, which is marked as 32, which extends substantially half-way between the edges 27a, 28a and the inner face of the case 29. The fluid can only circulate in the reduced space located between this boundary layer 32 and the inner face of the case 29. Between this boundary layer 32 and the closing wall 26a, the fluid does not circulate, or very little by forming mainly localised vortices.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the flow rate of gas which circulates between the end of the blade according to the invention and the case is reduced, because its actual passage section Jv, corresponding to the visible play for the fluid, is low by virtue of the pressure-side curvature which deviates the boundary layer 32 to the inner wall of the case.</p>
<p>In other words, the pressure-side curvature in the region of the blade apex makes bypassing this apex by the fluid more difficult, because this curvature tends to deviate the boundary layer 32 from the blade apex.</p>
<p>By way of comparison, Fig. 4 enables the position of the boundary layer and the visible play to be viewed in the case of a known blade of the type of Fig. 2, that is wherein the pressure side is straight instead of being curved. As is visible in Fig. 4, the pressure side parallel to the span direction gives rise to a boundary layer which, unlike the case of the invention, is very close to the closing wall. This boundary layer thus reduces very little the space allowing gas circulation between the blade apex and the inner face of the case, thus inducing a significant leak flow rate.</p>
<p>According to the invention, different geometrical configurations are possible for the blade, as illustrated in the different figures. Thus, in the example of Fig. 3, the pressure-side wall is curved from a region preceding the tub 29 with its closing wall 29 along the span axis, up to the terminal edge 27a of this pressure-side wall which extends in the continuity of the rest of the pressure-side wall. The curvature is oriented such that the pressure-side wall deviates from the span axis as the end of the blade apex S gets closer.</p>
<p>In this example of Fig. 3, the suction-side wall 24a is also curved, to be substantially equidistant from the pressure-side wall: the suction-side wall 24a gets closer to the span axis as the end of the blade apex S gets closer. The suction side 24a is also curved from a portion preceding the tub along the span axis EV, to the terminal edge 28a which extends from the bent portion of the suction-side wall 24a.</p>
<p>The shape of the curvature can advantageously be determined by the relationship below:</p>
<p><img src="media/image1.png" />.</p>
<p>In this relationship, Rmax designates the maximum blade radius, that is the distance separating the end of the blade apex from its axis of rotation AX, Rmin designates the blade radius where the pressure-side curvature starts, Rb designates the blade radius at its closing wall 26a. Δmax designates the desired maximum offset at the end of the blade apex, and n designates the power associated with the offset smoothing.</p>
<p>With this relationship, and as is illustrated in the graph of Fig. 7, the curvature shape of the wall is conditioned by the n value, with the proviso that for n = 1, a curved portion which is actually rectilinear or set is obtained, as in Fig. 5. This curved portion takes an increasingly curved shape when n increases, with the proviso that at the very end, when n tends to infinity, the curved portion becomes a planar portion perpendicular to the span axis.</p>
<p>This relationship defining the offset of the sections at the apex with respect to the skeleton of the trailing edge of the movable blade, enables losses due to the play vortex to be reduced.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for a given section corresponding to a radius R, the offset Δ(R) of the profile of the wall is made in perpendicular to the skeleton direction SQ of the blade at its trailing edge, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 6.</p>
<p>As will be understood, the vane shape according to the invention is defined from a vane having a pressure side and a suction side extending in parallel to the span axis. The sections of this vane are then offset by the offset value Δ(R), along a direction perpendicular to the orientation of the skeleton in the region of the trailing edge.</p>
<p>In the embodiment corresponding to Figs. 3 and 5, the pressure-side wall 23a and the suction-side wall 24a are both curved from a portion preceding the tub 29 or the closing wall 26a, up to their end edges 27a, 28a. The edges are thus oriented to extend from the pressure-side wall and the suction-side wall respectively.</p>
<p>Generally, the curved portion of the pressure-side and suction-side walls extends over a blade height that can be between five and thirty percent of the total blade height, the curvature being located in the region of the blade apex. The rest of the pressure-side or suction-side wall is on the contrary straight, that is parallel to the axis EV.</p>
<p>It is also possible to give to the terminal edges of the pressure side and suction side different inclinations or curvatures from those of the pressure-side wall and the succion-side wall in the region preceding the tub.</p>
<p>This is the case in the second embodiment of the invention illustrated in Fig. 8, wherein the blade 22b includes a pressure-side wall which is curved to deviate from the span axis in the region preceding the tub delimited by the closing wall 26b along the axis EV. But in this second embodiment, the terminal edge 27b of the pressure-side wall 23b is straight, that is it extends in parallel to the span direction EV.</p>
<p>In the same way, in this second embodiment, the suction-side wall 24b is also curved on a portion preceding the closing wall 26b by getting closer to the axis EV, but the edge 28b of this suction-side wall 24b is in turn straight, that is parallel to the axis EV.</p>
<p>It is still possible, alternatively, to provide that the edge 28b of the suction side 24b with a curvature reverse from the curvature of the suction-side wall in the region preceding the tub. In this case, the suction-side wall 24b gets closer to the axis EV in the region preceding the tub, and it deviates from this axis EV at its terminal edge. This arrangement enables among other things the tub to be widened in order to have greater efficiency.</p>
<p>In the third embodiment illustrated in Fig. 9, and which also aims at widening the tub, the blade 22c comprises a pressure-side wall 23c of the same type as that of the first embodiment corresponding to Figs. 3 and 5, that is curved to deviate from the axis EV, from a portion preceding the tub 29 up to its edge 27c which is curved in the same direction.</p>
<p>But in this third embodiment, the suction-side edge 24c is in turn straight including in the entire portion preceding the tub, and its terminal edge 28c, which contributes to delimiting the tub, is also curved to deviate from the axis EV, which gives to the tub a flared shape widening towards the blade end.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is also possible to provide that the suction-side wall 24c is curved to deviate from the span axis EV in the portion preceding the tub by being extended by its terminal edge which also deviates from the span axis. This alternative gives to the blade apex a flared shape providing the tub with a width higher than that of the second embodiment.</p>
<p>As is understood, the invention enables the direction of the pressure-side edge to be differently adapted from that of the suction-side edge with respect to the reference direction which is the shape of the corresponding wall under the tub region.</p>
<p>Generally, the invention enables leaks to be reduced at the blade apex without having to add material, thus mass, to the blade, which increases the turbine efficiency. The robustness of the turbine performance during the engine life is increased too.</p>
<p>The design flexibility brought about by the invention is summarised as a local modification which can be applied when the blades of an existing engine have to be removed.</p>
<p>The invention not only allows aerodynamic compensation but further does not oppose to curvature retrofits of the vane walls relating to a mechanical compensation offset. Advantageously, the aerodynamical compensation according to the invention is compatible with offsets of mechanical compensations, these offsets being for minimising stresses in the vane upon rotating.</p>
